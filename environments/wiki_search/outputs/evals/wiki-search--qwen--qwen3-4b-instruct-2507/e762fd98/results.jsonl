Bethesda advertised that the edition would include a [canvas](canvas) [bag](duffel)(duffel bag), but a [nylon](nylon) one was included instead. Responding to customer complaints, Bethesda claimed that the bag had to be changed due to unavailability of materials, and initially stated the intention to take no action. The publisher received criticism for not making the change known beforehand, with *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* pointing out that the bag's description on Bethesda's website had only changed to read \"nylon\" after complaints had been submitted. Bethesda later offered affected customers free in-game currency of 500 atoms as compensation, equivalent to . Critics pointed out this amount of currency was not enough to purchase the in-game postman uniform (700 atoms), which includes a canvas bag. Additionally, it was discovered that Bethesda had produced a different *Fallout 76*\u2013themed canvas bag and given them for free to [influencers](online)(Internet celebrity), further adding to the fan outrage. Bethesda announced on December 3, 2018, that they would be producing canvas bags for all owners of the Power Armor special edition, which were ultimately said to be shipping \"in four to six months.\" In June 2019, the bags were delivered to customers.\n\nA [breach](data)(data breach) occurred on December 5, 2018, when a [glitch](glitch) in Bethesda's [system](support)(Issue tracking system) revealed personal information of approximately 65 *Fallout 76* customers who had submitted a support ticket to receive the canvas bag. Users were able to open and close tickets of other customers and view personal information, including names, addresses, emails and partial credit card information. In a statement given to *[Technica](Ars)(Ars Technica)*, Bethesda said that the breach occurred via \"an error with our customer support website\" and that they are \"investigating the incident and will provide additional updates as we learn more\". The publisher clarified that the only information leaked were details that the support site would have requested, rather than credit card numbers or passwords, and that they would notify all affected customers.\n\nIn 2018, Bethesda partnered with the Silver Screen Bottling Company to create \"Nuka Dark Rum\", an alcoholic beverage based on the in-game \"Nuka-Cola Dark\" introduced in the *[4: Nuka-World](Fallout)(Fallout 4: Nuka-World)* [add-on](Downloadable content). The rum was available to be pre-ordered in August 2018 for . While its release was expected to coincide with the launch of *Fallout 76*, the rum was delayed and was shipped instead in late December 2018. Upon receiving it, fans criticized the fact that the rum bottle advertised, previously expected to be a bottle in the missile-like shape of the in-game Nuka-Cola item, had turned out to be a standard glass bottle encased in a large plastic cover. The rum's asking price of $80 was subsequently condemned from expectations that the design would be of high quality, since none of the marketing had stated what the bottles would be made of.\n\nIn September 2019, collectible \"Nuka Cola\"\u2013themed *Fallout* helmets produced by Chronicle Collectibles, of which only 32 of the 20,000 manufactured were sold, were recalled by the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](U.S.)(U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) due to containing high levels of mold and posing a health risk. No incidents or injuries were reported. [GameStop](GameStop), which sold the helmets, notified all customers who had purchased a helmet and offered them a full refund.\n\nIn June 2022, a *Kotaku* article published reports from ten anonymous former employees of Bethesda and its parent company [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) of severe mismanagement during *Fallout 76*s development. The reports claimed that [crunch](Crunch (video games)) had been enforced, leading to an \"exodus\" of senior developers from the company. The loss of staff led to Bethesda borrowing developers working on [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios)' *[Redfall](Redfall)* and Bethesda's *[Starfield](Starfield (video game))* to assist with *Fallout 76*. Other alleged issues included technical problems with the game's design and engine, as well as these concerns being ignored by senior management.

For example, \"Cassilda's Song\" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:\"The King in Yellow\" in e.g.\n\nThe short story \"The Mask\" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:\"The Mask\" in e.g.\n\nIt is also stated, in \"The Repairer of Reputations\", that the final moment of the first act involves the character Camilla's \"agonized scream and [...] awful words echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa\".\n\nAll of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the \"irresistible\" revealed truths: \"The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect\". Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: \"If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it\" (\"[Repairer of Reputations](The)(The Repairer of Reputations)\").\n\nChambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from \"The Repairer of Reputations\":\n\nHe mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades.

Tungsten's desirable properties such as resistance to high temperatures, its hardness and density, and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry, both as a constituent of weapons and equipment and employed in production itself, e.g., in [carbide](tungsten)(tungsten carbide) cutting tools for machining steel.\n\nNow tungsten is used in many more applications such as aircraft & motorsport ballast weights, darts, anti-vibration tooling, and sporting equipment.\n\nTungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings.

Before meeting Edward, Martin reveals to the warden, Moss, that he was brought in to fill in for Dr. Stewart, who was Edward's regular visitor for this procedure. Stewart had died by suicide the night before, causing Martin to replace him. Edward is scheduled to die via electrocution at his insistence that very day and Moss explains to Martin that Edward's fate depends upon Martin's diagnosis; if Martin deduces that Edward is sane, he will be executed, but if Martin declares him insane with multi-personality disorder as Stewart had believed, Edward will be spared.\n\nWhen Martin takes a seat to interrogate Edward, the inmate refuses to be identified as a human and instead a demon inhabiting Edward's body named \"Nefariamous,\" a name Satan gave him  \"Nefarious\" for short. Martin does not believe Nefarious is who he says he is and thinks instead that it is an act by Edward to seem insane; however, he is surprised when Nefarious insists that he wants to be executed, or rather, that he wants Edward to be executed. Nefarious also explains that before the day is over, Martin will commit three murders.\n\nMartin, an atheist, balks at this idea but plays along, asking Nefarious how he came to inhabit Edward. Nefarious explains that he possessed Edward through a process carried out through Edward\u2019s life, beginning with ease of access through Edward\u2019s never having been [baptized](baptized), continuing through seemingly innocuous events such as Edward\u2019s grandmother having given him a [board](ouija)(ouija board) as a present, allowing manipulative communication, finally completing the process only after Edward consented to the possession multiple times. Martin brings in a chaplain to confront the demon in Edward, which frightens Nefarious until he realizes that the priest does not believe in demons and therefore has no effect on him. Martin then asks to talk to Edward, causing Nefarious to recede and produce a timid, childlike Edward who is terribly distraught and shaken by his possession. Edward insists that he is possessed and that the demon had murdered multiple people using his innocent body as a vessel.\n\nWhen Martin begins probing further, Nefarious takes control and insists that Martin euthanized his terminally ill mother to acquire her massive wealth. Martin becomes angry and threatens to leave the meeting, but changes his mind. When Martin decides to write Nefarious off as insane, Nefarious explains that Martin's girlfriend is pregnant, and because Martin threatened to leave her, she is terminating her pregnancy. Overcome with curiosity, Martin begs a kindly prison guard for access to a phone, which he uses to call the health clinic from where he realizes his girlfriend has just finished with the abortion. Nefarious cackles with glee, explaining to Martin that \"all hell is rejoicing.\"\n\nMartin still remains doubtful Nefarious is possessed, but is fully intrigued to hear what the inmate has to tell him. After Martin insists that the world is reclaiming the moral high ground, Nefarious laughs before telling him there is currently an influx of slavery and human trafficking which the demons are helping with. Nefarious then explains he wants Martin to write a book called *The Dark Gospel*, which is his Satanic equivalent to the Bible and will begin another world religion in servitude to demons. Martin is called away by Warden Moss who reveals to him that upon searching Edward's prison cell, they found documentation of Martin's life as Nefarious had done with all his other victims, as well as the dark gospel which Edward wrote, crediting it to Martin's name. Martin, now believing Edward is faking split personalities, confronts Nefarious about this. Nefarious breaks his own hand to slip free of one of the cuffs and seizes Martin, threatening to break his neck unless Martin begs for his life. Overcome with terror, Martin begs Nefarious to spare him to which Nefarious complies before being beaten down by the prison guards. Instinctively, Martin declares that Edward is sane, but not before being warned by a triumphant Nefarious that he is condemning Edward to death.\n\nAs Edward is in the electric chair, Nefarious possesses his body for a final time, asking if Martin accepts his offer, to which Martin silently refuses. Disappointed, Nefarious leaves Edward's body, causing Edward to suffer an extremely painful and terrible death in the chair. The demon then tells Martin, \"You should have accepted my offer,\" before possessing him and trying to force Martin to commit suicide. However, Martin inadvertently prays to God for help, causing the gun to misfire and Nefarious to let go of him. One year later, a visibly changed Martin is shown promoting Nefarious' book  not as a \"dark gospel\" but as a rewritten cautionary tale for people to read and realize the demonic influence in society. On his way home, Martin bumps into a homeless woman whom Nefarious has now possessed.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The name of the demon possessing the death-row inmate in the film *Nefarious* is **Nefariamous**, who is referred to as \"Nefarious\" for short.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":0.0,"generation_ms":6894.5291042328,"scoring_ms":395.7962989807,"total_ms":7290.5833721161,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Nefarious","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":0.0}

Both Dacus and Bridgers had opened for Baker on separate tours in 2016, and they all ran in similar circles as young up-and-coming performers navigating the [indie](Independent music) scene.\n\nThe three became close and shared their frustrations of constantly being compared to each other as \"[in rock](women)(women in rock)\" despite their considerably different musical styles. Dacus has commented that the idea of women in music \"should not be remarkable whatsoever,\" with Bridgers adding, \"it's not a genre.\" Each has spoken on the tendency of the music industry to pit women against each other, and the group was formed in part to reject this idea. \"I hope people see the three of us and know there isn't competition,\" Dacus has said. \"You don't have to compete with your contemporaries. You can make something good with people you admire.\"\n\nBaker had joked to Dacus years before about a \"pipe dream\" that they could one day all form a band. The three decided to book a [tour](co-headlining)(Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers with Lucy Dacus Tour) in early 2018, and they originally planned to record a single or a [version](cover)(cover version) so that they could perform something together on stage. Upon meeting up that summer, however, they found themselves overwhelmed with ideas, and they ended up forming the band, writing, recording, and self-producing the *[Boygenius](Boygenius (EP))* [EP](Extended play) in four days, with the process involving almost exclusively women.\n\nEach brought one full song and one incomplete idea with them to the group. They sought to create an environment free of the competitiveness and \"bravado\" they had often encountered in previous experiences, and they have remarked that the absence of adult men in the process proved significant, allowing them to relate to each other openly without constantly having to explain themselves. The record was met with universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike; it was named the 12th best album of 2018 by [Music](NPR)(NPR Music), despite being only an [EP](Extended play). Their subsequent [tour](Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers with Lucy Dacus Tour) that November saw them performing all across the U.S., as well as on *[Night with Seth Meyers](Late)(Late Night with Seth Meyers)* and the [Desk](Tiny)(List of Tiny Desk Concerts).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The three musicians who formed the indie rock supergroup Boygenius in 2018 are Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":6193.9103603363,"scoring_ms":358.6759567261,"total_ms":6555.1512241364,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

At [2019](E3)(E3 2019), Xbox Game Studios announced it had acquired [Fine](Double)(Double Fine), and established a new internal studio dedicated to *Age of Empires* headed by Shannon Loftis, bringing their total studio count to fifteen. This studio, later named World's Edge, does not directly develop any games, but oversees efforts from external studios, such as [Entertainment](Relic)(Relic Entertainment), Forgotten Empires and [Media](Tantalus)(Tantalus Media), to assure the series is being developed in the right direction, according to creative director Adam Isgreen.\n\nBooty has stated that with studios like Obsidian, Ninja Theory, and Double Fine, which have traditionally supported multiplatform games, they will determine if it makes sense for their future products to be treated as Microsoft-exclusive content for Xbox and Windows computers, or to allow these to be published across multiple platforms. That decision will be based on a \"network effect\", whether having these games on other platforms will better support the franchise and thus worthwhile for Microsoft to help dedicate resources towards it, such as they had with *Minecraft*. Xbox Game Studios has allowed some of the content developed by its studios or that was previously published exclusively for the Xbox and Windows systems to be released on [Nintendo](Nintendo) systems, notably the [Switch](Nintendo)(Nintendo Switch) versions of *[Cuphead](Cuphead)* from Studio MDHR and *[and the Blind Forest](Ori)(Ori and the Blind Forest)* from Moon Studios, and allowing for the titular characters from Rare's *[Banjo-Kazooie](Banjo-Kazooie)* into *[Smash Bros. Ultimate](Super)(Super Smash Bros. Ultimate)*. However, the division stated that these releases were generally \"existing commitments to other platforms\" that they allowed studios to honor, but they otherwise have \"no plans to further expand our exclusive first party games to other consoles.\"\n\nNear the end of 2019, with the combined fifteen studios now under Xbox Game Studios, Booty stated that they now had more games than ever to handle, and were likely not going to acquire any additional studios in the near future, stating \"we've been shifting our focus inside Xbox Game Studios from acquisition and growth, to a phase of execution and delivery\". Additionally, as Microsoft started promotion of its fourth-generation of Xbox, including the [Series X](Xbox)(Xbox Series X), Booty stated that titles developed by Xbox Game Studios in year or two following its release will not be exclusively for the new generation of consoles, but instead will support both Xbox One and the new console, with some games receiving enhanced performance when played on the new console lineup. Booty said that with the large number of studios they had recently acquired, as well as ongoing external partnerships and their [Game Pass](Xbox)(Xbox Game Pass) service, the Studios are able to support a \"breadth of offerings in the portfolio\" designed to attract a large number of players. Further, in an interview in November 2020, Phil Spencer said during an interview regarding the future of the Xbox brand that he intends to put more focus on outputting [RPG](Role-playing video game)s, which had to that point been underserved.\n\nMicrosoft and [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) announced on September 21, 2020, that Microsoft planned to acquire ZeniMax and its family of studios, which include [Game Studios](Bethesda)(Bethesda Game Studios), [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios), [Software](id)(id Software), [MachineGames](MachineGames), [Gameworks](Tango)(Tango Gameworks), and [Online Studios](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Online Studios), for over  in cash. According to Spencer, the ZeniMax acquisition was intended to give Microsoft a large library of games known around the world, and to expand the library of Xbox Game Pass and [XCloud](XCloud). Both U.S. and European Union regulatory agencies approved the acquisition by early March 2021, and the acquisition was formally completed by March 9, 2021. The total price of the deal was $8.1 billion Bethesda Softworks, the primarily publisher for all of ZeniMax's games, remained as an operational unit under Microsoft with the acquisition and retained all its current leadership. With the acquisition, future games from the studios will be exclusive to Xbox consoles, but existing commitments to other platforms (such as Arkane Studios' *[Deathloop](Deathloop)* and Tango Gameworks' *[Tokyo](Ghostwire:)(Ghostwire: Tokyo)*, which are contractually exclusive to [5](PlayStation)(PlayStation 5)) will still be honored. Spencer stated that Game Pass was also fundamental driver for the acquisition. A preliminary injunction to block the acquisition had been sought in an ongoing class-action lawsuit that ZeniMax faced over *[4](Fallout)(Fallout 4)*, with the plaintiffs in the case arguing that Microsoft could shield ZeniMax's assets from damages should they be found liable after the acquisition. The ZeniMax Board of Directors was dissolved following the Microsoft purchase.\n\nOn January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire [Blizzard](Activision)(Activision Blizzard) in an all-cash deal valued at $68.7 billion. Microsoft stated that this acquisition would make it the third-largest gaming company by revenue, following [Tencent](Tencent) and [Sony](Sony). With the announcement, Microsoft also announced a major change to its corporate structure, with Phil Spencer becoming CEO of the new division Microsoft Gaming, with Matt Booty leading Xbox Game Studios under it. Once approved, Activision Blizzard will then become a subdivision of Microsoft Gaming.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The value of Microsoft's acquisition deal for ZeniMax Media in 2020 was $8.1 billion.

It stands on a platform or [stylobate](stylobate) of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [and lintel](post)(post and lintel) construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an [entablature](entablature). There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the *[cella](cella),* which is divided into two compartments. The *[opisthodomos](opisthodomos)* (the back room of the cella) contained the monetary contributions of the Delian League. At either end of the building, the [gable](gable) is finished with a triangular [pediment](pediment) originally occupied by sculpted figures.\n\nThe Parthenon has been described as \"the culmination of the development of the Doric order.\"\"Parthenon.\" *Britannica Library*, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 10 September 2021. Accessed 16 July 2022. The Doric columns, for example, have simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [frieze](frieze) of carved pictorial panels ([metopes](Metope (architecture))), separated by formal architectural [triglyph](triglyph)s, also typical of the Doric order. The continuous [frieze](frieze) in low relief around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns, in contrast, reflects the Ionic order. Architectural historian John R. Senseney suggests that this unexpected switch between orders was due to an aesthetic choice on the part of builders during construction, and was likely not part of the original plan of the Parthenon.\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are . The cella was 29.8&nbsp;metres long by 19.2&nbsp;metres wide (97.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;63.0&nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure  in diameter and are  high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column having 20 flutes. (A flute is the [concave](wikt:concave) shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [and tegulae](imbrices)(imbrex and tegula).\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. [Julius Cooper](John)(John Julius Cooper) wrote that \"even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [naos](naos (architecture)) walls, and the [entasis](entasis) of the columns.\"John Julius Norwich, *Great Architecture of the World*, 2001, p. 63 Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of , in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, *Principles of Athenian Architecture* 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9). it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outward, but they actually lean slightly inward so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly  above the centre of the Parthenon. Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [architrave](architrave) and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.Penrose *op. cit.* pp. 32\u201334, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P. Stevens, \"Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon\" *American Journal of Archaeology* **66**.3 (July 1962:337\u2013338).\n\n[[East Facade pf the Parthenon on March 22, 2021.jpg|thumb|left|The east facade|upright=1.2](File:The)]\n\nIt is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these \"optical refinements\" was. They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion.\"Archaeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory. *Nova*, \"Secrets of the Parthenon,\" PBS. http:\/\/video.yahoo.com\/watch\/1849622\/6070405 As the Greeks may have been aware, two [parallel](parallel (geometry)) lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines. In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its facade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the [ratio](golden)(golden ratio).Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis,\" *Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly*, Vol. 46, 1998. More recent studies have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The provided text does not specify the names of the two architects responsible for the design of the Parthenon.

At the end of 1957, American Express CEO [Reed](Ralph)(Ralph Reed (American Express)) decided to get into the card business, and by the launch date of October 1, 1958, public interest had become so significant that 250,000 cards were issued prior to the official launch date. The card was launched with an annual fee of $6, $1 higher than Diners Club, to be seen as a premium product. The first cards were made of paper, with the account number and card member's name typed. In 1959, American Express began issuing embossed plastic cards, an industry first., the company had 133.3 million cards in force, including 56.4million cards in force in the United States, each with average annual spending of $23,496. These include consumer, small business and corporate cards issued by American Express themselves and cards issued by its Global Service Network partners that run on its network (such as Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, and NAB in Australia and Lloyds Bank and Barclays Bank in the UK). On March 1, 2017, Australia's fourth-largest bank ANZ announced that it was no longer issuing American Express cards, with the support phased out entirely by August 5, 2017. American Express is the fourth largest general-purpose card network on a global basis based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and MasterCard. It is the 4th largest card network in the world, based on the number of cards it has in circulation. American Express is one of the partner banks to both [Google](Google) and [Apple](Apple Inc.)'s mobile wallet systems ([Pay](Google)(Google Wallet) and [Pay](Apple)(Apple Pay), respectively) meaning that cardholders can use their American Express-issued cards to pay at establishments where [NFC](Near field communication) payments are accepted.

He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. \"The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever\", he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.\n\nA similar passage occurs in \"The Yellow Sign\", in which two protagonists have read *The King in Yellow*:\n\nNight fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city.

Unlike [liner](ocean)(ocean liner)s, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports-of-call, where passengers may go on [tours](Tourism) known as \"shore excursions\". They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by the [tonnage](gross)(gross tonnage)(GT), bigger than many [ships](cargo)(List of largest container ships). Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s; before then, few were more than 50,000GT. In the decades since, the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled. There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000GT or greater. In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). , the largest cruise ship, , has a gross tonnage of 236,857, is  long,  wide, and holds up to 6,988 passengers.\n\nCruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship's crew. Modern cruise ships, while sacrificing some qualities of [seaworthiness](seakeeping), have added amenities to cater to [tourists](nautical)(nautical tourism), with recent vessels being described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\". The \"megaships\" went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas, and feature ameneties such as theaters, fine-dining and chain restaurants, spas, fitness centers, casinos, sports facilities, and even amusement park attractions.\n\nCruise ships require electricity for powering both hotel services and for [propulsion](Marine propulsion). Cruise ships are designed with all the heavy machinery at the bottom of the ship and lightweight materials at the top, making them inherently stable even as ship designs are getting taller and taller, and most passenger ships utilize [fins](stabilizer)(Stabilizer (ship)) to further reduce rolling of tall ships in heavy weather. While some cruise ships use traditional fixed [propeller](propeller)s and [rudder](rudder)s to steer, most larger ships use propellers that can swivel left and right to steer the ship, known as [thruster](azimuth)(azimuth thruster)s, which allow even the largest ship designs to have adequate maneuverability.\n\nCruise ships are operated by [line](cruise)(cruise line)s, which are [companies](company) that market cruises to the public. In the 1990s, many cruise lines were bought by much larger holding companies and continue to operate as brands or subsidiaries of the holding company. For instance, [Corporation & plc](Carnival)(Carnival Corporation & plc) owns both the [mass-market](Mass market) [Cruise Line](Carnival)(Carnival Cruise Line), focused on larger party ships for younger travelers, and [America Line](Holland)(Holland America Line), whose smaller ships cultivate an image of classic elegance. The common practice in the cruise industry in ship sales and orders is to list the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, as the recipient cruise line of the ship.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The gross tonnage of the largest cruise ship as of 2023 is **236,857 GT**.

He employed Orthodox liturgical themes in the *[Easter Festival Overture](Russian)(Russian Easter Festival Overture)*, folk song in *[Espagnol](Capriccio)(Capriccio Espagnol)* and orientalism in *[Scheherazade](Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov))*, possibly his best known work.Maes, pp. 175\u2013176. He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self-critical one. He revised every orchestral work up to and including his Third Symphony\u2014some, like *[Antar](Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov))* and *[Sadko](Sadko (musical tableau))*, more than once. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale [transposition](transposition (music)) and complete recomposition.Abraham, *Slavonic*, pp. 197\u2013198.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov was open about the influences in his music, telling Vasily Yastrebtsev, \"Study Liszt and Balakirev more closely, and you'll see that a great deal in me is not mine\".Yastrebtsev, p. 37. He followed Balakirev in his use of the whole tone scale, treatment of folk songs and musical [orientalism](orientalism) and Liszt for harmonic adventurousness. (The violin melody used to portray [Scheherazade](Scheherazade) is very closely related to its counterpart in Balakirev's symphonic poem *[Tamara](Tamara (Balakirev))*, while the *Russian Easter Overtures* follows the design and plan of Balakirev's Second Overture on Russian Themes.)\n\nNevertheless, while he took Glinka and Liszt as his harmonic models, his use of [tone](whole)(whole tone scale) and [scale](octatonic)(octatonic scale)s do demonstrate his originality. He developed both these compositional devices for the \"fantastic\" sections of his operas, which depicted magical or supernatural characters and events.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov maintained an interest in harmonic experiments and continued exploring new idioms throughout his career. He tempered this interest with an abhorrence of excess and kept his tendency to experiment under constant control. The more radical his harmonies became, the more he attempted to control them with strict rules\u2014applying his \"musical conscience\", as he called it.

In 2004, it released the [Portable](PlayStation)(PlayStation Portable) (PSP) to compete with the [DS](Nintendo)(Nintendo DS) as part of the [generation of video game consoles](seventh)(seventh generation of video game consoles). After a slow start in the worldwide market, it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the *[Hunter](Monster)(Monster Hunter)* series. With the series being less popular in western regions, it failed to revive the platform in the same way. The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company. It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share, with almost 80 million units sold in its lifespan, roughly the same amount as Nintendo's [Boy Advance](Game)(Game Boy Advance) had during the [generation of video game consoles](sixth)(sixth generation of video game consoles). This is only a little more than half of the sales of its actual market competitor, the DS, which was more than 150 million units by the end of 2011.\n\nRumors of a successor to the PSP came as early as July 2009 when *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* reported that Sony was working on such a device, which would utilize the PowerVR SGX543MP processor and perform at a level similar to the original [Xbox](Xbox (console)). Through mid-2010, websites continued to run stories about accounts of the existence of a \"PSP 2\". Reports arose during the [Game Show](Tokyo)(Tokyo Game Show) that the device was unveiled internally during a private meeting during mid-September held at Sony Computer Entertainment's headquarters in Aoyama, Tokyo. Shortly after, reports of [kits](development)(development kits) for the handheld had reportedly already been shipped to numerous video game developers including both [first-party](SIE Worldwide Studios) and third-party developers to start making games for the device, a report later confirmed by *[Kombat](Mortal)(Mortal Kombat (2011 video game))* Executive Producer Shaun Himmerick. By November, Senior Vice President of [Arts](Electronic)(Electronic Arts), Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that he had seen that the PlayStation Portable successor existed, but could not confirm details. In the same month, [VG247](VG247) released pictures of an early prototype version showing a [Go](PSP)(PSP Go)-like slide-screen design along with two analog sticks, two cameras and a microphone, though the report mentioned that overheating issues had since caused them to move away from the design in favor of a model more similar to the original PlayStation Portable device.\n\nThroughout 2010, Sony would not confirm these reports of a PSP successor but would make comments regarding making future hardware. [Yoshida](Shuhei)(Shuhei Yoshida), President of [Worldwide Studios](SCE)(SCE Worldwide Studios) revealed that his studio, despite usually being more involved with software, had a continued role in future hardware development at the time. In December, [Computer Entertainment](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment) CEO [Hirai](Kazuo)(Kazuo Hirai) stated that Sony aimed to appeal to a wide demographic of people by using multiple input methods on future hardware; buttons and joysticks for traditional handheld game system users, and touchscreens for [phone](smart)(smart phone) users. The device was officially announced by Sony on January 27, 2011, at their \"PlayStation Meeting\" press conference held by the company in Japan. The system, only known by its code name \"Next Generation Portable\", was announced to be a handheld gaming device that aimed for [3](PlayStation)(PlayStation 3) quality visuals, which was later clarified to not be taken at a literal level because, according to David Coombes, platform research manager at [Computer Entertainment America](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment America), \"Well, it's not going to run at 2&nbsp;GHz [the PS3](like) because the battery would last five minutes and it would probably set fire to your pants\". Its power was later described by Sony engineers as about halfway between the PSP and PS3. As rumors had suggested, the device was designed to present \"the best of both worlds\" between mobile and handheld gaming, including a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, a rear touchpad coupled with physical buttons and dual analog sticks. Sony also revealed that the device would be using a mix of retail and digital distribution of games. Further details were announced at [Developers Conference](Game)(Game Developers Conference) 2011, including that Sony would be dropping the PSP's [UMD](Universal Media Disc) disc format in favor of small game cartridges of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB size variants.  along with two cameras, facial detection, head detection and tracking capabilities.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The codename used for the PlayStation Vita before its official announcement was \"Next Generation Portable\".","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":5083.3337306976,"scoring_ms":2915.789604187,"total_ms":8001.5711784363,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Next Generation Portable","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

recreational hunting of polar bears in [Canada](Canada)]]\n\nPolar bears were designated \"Not at Risk\" in April 1986 and uplisted to \"Special Concern\" in April 1991. This status was re-evaluated and confirmed in April 1999, November 2002, and April 2008. Polar bears continue to be listed as a species of special concern in Canada because of their sensitivity to overharvest and because of an expected range contraction caused by loss of Arctic sea ice.\n\nMore than 600 bears are killed per year by humans across Canada, a rate calculated by scientists to be unsustainable for some areas, notably [Bay](Baffin)(Baffin Bay). Canada has allowed sport hunters accompanied by local guides and dog-sled teams since 1970, but the practice was not common until the 1980s. The guiding of sport hunters provides meaningful employment and an important source of income for northern communities in which economic opportunities are few. Sport hunting can bring CDN$20,000 to $35,000 per bear into northern communities, which until recently has been mostly from American hunters.\n\nThe territory of [Nunavut](Nunavut) accounts for the location 80% of annual kills in Canada. In 2005, the government of Nunavut increased the quota from 400 to 518 bears, despite protests from the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group. In two areas where harvest levels have been increased based on increased sightings, science-based studies have indicated declining populations, and a third area is considered data-deficient. While most of that quota is hunted by the indigenous Inuit, a growing share is sold to recreational hunters. (0.8% in the 1970s, 7.1% in the 1980s, and 14.6% in the 1990s) Nunavut polar bear biologist, [Taylor](Mitchell)(Mitchell Taylor), who was formerly responsible for polar bear conservation in the territory, has insisted that bear numbers are being sustained under current hunting limits. In 2010, the 2005 increase was partially reversed. Government of Nunavut officials announced that the polar bear quota for the Baffin Bay region would be gradually reduced from 105 per year to 65 by 2013. The Government of the [Territories](Northwest)(Northwest Territories) maintain their own quota of 72 to 103 bears within the [Inuvialuit](Inuvialuit) communities of which some are set aside for sports hunters. [Canada](Environment)(Environment Canada) also banned the export from Canada of fur, claws, skulls and other products from polar bears harvested in Baffin Bay as of 1 January 2010.\n\nBecause of the way polar bear hunting quotas are managed in Canada, attempts to discourage sport hunting would actually increase the number of bears killed in the short term. Canada allocates a certain number of permits each year to sport and subsistence hunting, and those that are not used for sport hunting are re-allocated to indigenous subsistence hunting. Whereas northern communities kill all the polar bears they are permitted to take each year, only half of sport hunters with permits actually manage to kill a polar bear. If a sport hunter does not kill a polar bear before his or her permit expires, the permit cannot be transferred to another hunter.\n\nIn August 2011, [Canada](Environment)(Environment Canada) published a national polar bear conservation strategy.[National Polar Bear Conservation Strategy for Canada](http:\/\/www.ec.gc.ca\/nature\/default.asp?Lang=En&n=60D0FDBD-1)\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-abd4950fd0f149d0a3861052fa41d62a\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"polar_bear:greenland\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"#### Greenland\n\nIn Greenland, hunting restrictions were first introduced in 1994 and expanded by executive order in 2005. Until 2005 Greenland placed no limit on hunting by indigenous people. However, in 2006 it imposed a limit of 150, while also allowed recreational hunting for the first time.Rose, Naomi A.

Some regulations of hunting did exist. In 1927, poisoning was outlawed while in 1939, certain denning sights were declared off limits. The killing of females and cubs was made illegal in 1965. Killing of polar bears decreased somewhat 25\u201330 years before the treaty. Despite this, the polar bear population continued to decline and by 1973, only around 1000 bears were left in Svalbard.

He's a schoolteacher, and a very successful one at that, like making the world better.

And even if we had Nicholson come back, based on the rules of the hotel and how the ghosts appear with respect to their age, he'd be performing the part through a digital avatar.\" Flanagan said that [and digital actors](de-aging)(De-aging in motion pictures), while improving rapidly, were still inadequate. \"The idea of having a digital Danny Torrance riding a trike five minutes into the movie, that just seemed like we were making a video game at that point. It felt disrespectful.\" Noting that any solution would be controversial, the director decided that the best approach \"was not to do impressions; it was to find actors who would remind us of those iconic performances, without ever tipping into parody... I just want to be able to tilt people's memories toward those original actors, but then let the characters be their own. I want to cast someone to play Dick Hallorann; I don't want to cast someone to play Scatman Crothers\". The idea of casting a Nicholson impersonator as Jack was also considered, as was casting a big-name actor associated with or reminiscent of Nicholson, such as [DiCaprio](Leonardo)(Leonardo DiCaprio) or [Slater](Christian)(Christian Slater).

[instruction](programmed)(programmed instruction)]]\n\nA tenet of behavioral research is that a large part of both human and lower-animal behavior is learned. A principle associated with behavioral research is that the mechanisms involved in learning apply to humans and non-human animals. Behavioral researchers have developed a treatment known as [modification](behavior)(behavior modification), which is used to help individuals replace undesirable behaviors with desirable ones.\n\n[[Albert experiment (1920).webm|250px|thumb|thumbtime=192|The film of the Little Albert experiment](File:Little)] Early behavioral researchers studied stimulus\u2013response pairings, now known as [conditioning](classical)(classical conditioning). They demonstrated that when a biologically potent stimulus (e.g., food that elicits salivation) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g., a bell) over several learning trials, the neutral stimulus by itself can come to elicit the response the biologically potent stimulus elicits. [Pavlov](Ivan)(Ivan Pavlov)\u2014known best for inducing dogs to salivate in the presence of a stimulus previously linked with food\u2014became a leading figure in the Soviet Union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans. In the United States, [Lee Thorndike](Edward)(Edward Lee Thorndike) initiated \"[connectionist](connectionism)\" studies by trapping animals in \"puzzle boxes\" and rewarding them for escaping. Thorndike wrote in 1911, \"There can be no moral warrant for studying man's nature unless the study will enable us to control his acts.\" From 1910 to 1913 the American Psychological Association went through a sea change of opinion, away from [mentalism](Mentalism (psychology)) and towards \"behavioralism.\" In 1913, John B. Watson coined the term behaviorism for this school of thought. Watson's famous [Albert experiment](Little)(Little Albert experiment) in 1920 was at first thought to demonstrate that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill [phobia](phobia)s (aversions to other stimuli) in an infant human,J.B. Watson & R. Rayner, \"Conditioned emotional responses\", *Journal of Experimental Psychology* 3, 1920; in Hock, *Forty Studies* (2002), pp. 70\u201376. although such a conclusion was likely an exaggeration.Harris, B. (1979). Whatever happened to Little Albert? *American Psychologist, 34*, 151-160. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1037\/0003-066X.34.2.151  https:\/\/archive.today\/20120803155410\/http:\/\/htpprints.yorku.ca\/archive\/00000198\/01\/BHARRIS.HTM#selection-15.0-15.35 [Lashley](Karl)(Karl Lashley), a close collaborator with Watson, examined biological manifestations of learning in the brain.\n\n[L. Hull](Clark)(Clark L. Hull), [Guthrie](Edwin)(Edwin Guthrie), and others did much to help behaviorism become a widely used paradigm. A new method of \"instrumental\" or \"[operant](operant conditioning)\" conditioning added the concepts of [reinforcement](reinforcement) and [punishment](punishment) to the model of behavior change. [behaviorists](Radical)(Radical behaviorism) avoided discussing the inner workings of the mind, especially the unconscious mind, which they considered impossible to assess scientifically. Operant conditioning was first described by Miller and Kanorski and popularized in the U.S. by [Skinner](B.F.)(B.F. Skinner), who emerged as a leading intellectual of the behaviorist movement.Skinner, B.F. (1932) *The Behavior of Organisms*\n\n[Chomsky](Noam)(Noam Chomsky) published an influential critique of radical behaviorism on the grounds that behaviorist principles could not adequately explain the complex mental process of [acquisition](language)(language acquisition) and language use.Chomsky, N. (1959). Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior. *Language, 35*, 26\u201358. [http:\/\/www.chomsky.info\/articles\/1967----.htm]  The review, which was scathing, did much to reduce the status of behaviorism within psychology. [Seligman](Martin)(Martin Seligman) and his colleagues discovered that they could condition in dogs a state of \"[helplessness](learned)(learned helplessness)\", which was not predicted by the behaviorist approach to psychology. [C. Tolman](Edward)(Edward C. Tolman) advanced a hybrid \"cognitive behavioral\" model, most notably with his 1948 publication discussing the [map](cognitive)(cognitive map)s used by rats to guess at the location of food at the end of a maze. Skinner's behaviorism did not die, in part because it generated successful practical applications.\n\nThe [for Behavior Analysis International](Association)(Association for Behavior Analysis International) was founded in 1974 and by 2003 had members from 42 countries. The field has gained a foothold in Latin America and Japan.Ruben Ardila, \"Behavior Analysis in an International Context\", in Brock (ed.), *Internationalizing the History of Psychology* (2006). [behavior analysis](Applied)(Applied behavior analysis) is the term used for the application of the principles of operant conditioning to change socially significant behavior (it supersedes the term, \"behavior modification\").\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"John B.

There is general agreement that it arose in the Southern United States \u2013 a region that would produce most of the major early rock and roll acts \u2013 through the meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the African musical tradition with European instrumentation.M. T. Bertrand, *Race, Rock, and Elvis: Music in American Life* (University of Illinois Press, 2000), pp. 21\u201322. [migration of many former slaves and their descendants to major urban centers](The)(Second Great Migration (African American)) such as [Louis](St.)(St. Louis), [Memphis](Memphis, Tennessee), [York City](New)(New York City), [Detroit](Detroit), [Chicago](Chicago), [Cleveland](Cleveland), and [Buffalo](Buffalo, New York) meant that black and white residents were living in close proximity in larger numbers than ever before, and as a result heard each other's music and even began to emulate each other's fashions.R. Aquila, *That old-time rock & roll: a chronicle of an era, 1954\u20131963* (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2000), pp. 4\u20136.J. M. Salem, ''The late, great Johnny Ace and the transition from R & B to rock 'n' roll Music in American life* (University of Illinois Press, 2001), p. 4. Radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to both groups, the development and spread of the [record](gramophone)(gramophone record), and African-American musical styles such as [jazz](jazz) and [swing](Swing music) which were taken up by white musicians, aided this process of \"cultural collision\".M. T. Bertrand, *Race, rock, and Elvis Music in American life'' (University of Illinois Press, 2000), p. 99.\n\n[[File:Chuck Berry 1957.jpg|thumb|right|[Berry](Chuck)(Chuck Berry) in 1957]]\n\nThe immediate roots of rock and roll lay in the [and blues](rhythm)(rhythm and blues), then called \"[music](race)(race music)\", in combination with either boogie-woogie and shouting gospel or with [music](country)(country music) of the 1940s and 1950s. Particularly significant influences were jazz, [blues](blues), [gospel](Gospel music), country, and [folk](folk music). Commentators differ in their views of which of these forms were most important and the degree to which the new music was a re-branding of African-American [and blues](rhythm)(rhythm and blues) for a white market, or a new hybrid of black and white forms.A. Bennett, *Rock and Popular Music: Politics, Policies, Institutions* (Routledge, 1993), pp. 236\u2013238.K. Keightley, \"Reconsidering rock\", in S. Frith, W. Straw and J.

According to Blum, true rock tracks from the 1940s included \"Rock Woogie\" by Jim Wynn's Bobalibans (1945), \"Rockin' the House\" by Memphis Slim and the House Rockers (1946), \"Aladdin Boogie\" by Amos Milburn (1947), \"Rock and Rye\" by Jimmy McCracklin (1947), \"We're Gonna Rock\" (1947) and \"Rock and Roll\" (1948) by Wild Bill Moore, and many others. His discussion of the topic is as follows:, text in both English pp17-18 and French pp 3-4.\n\nThe music was also called \"blues\" (*My Baby Left Me* by [Crudup](Arthur)(Arthur Crudup)), \"rhythm music\" (\"Hambone\" by [Saunders](Red)(Red Saunders (musician))), \"rhythm and blues\" (\"Honey Hush\" by [Joe Turner](Big)(Big Joe Turner)), \"R&B\" (the abbreviation of \"rhythm and blues\" and the name given to \"black\" music styles in the charts of Billboard magazine post-summer 1949), \"jump blues\" (\"Rock Around the Clock\" by [Singer](Hal)(Hal Singer)), \"big beat\", \"rock 'n' roll\" or \"race music\", was the label used by the press and Billboard in particular.}}\n\nIn the 1930s, [jazz](jazz), and particularly [swing](Swing music), both in urban-based dance bands and blues-influenced country swing ([Rodgers](Jimmie)(Jimmie Rodgers), [Mullican](Moon)(Moon Mullican) and other similar singers), were among the first music to present African-American sounds for a predominantly white audience.E. Wald, *How the Beatles Destroyed Rock N Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), pp. 111\u2013125. One particularly noteworthy example of a jazz song with recognizably rock and roll elements is [Joe Turner](Big)(Big Joe Turner) with pianist [Johnson](Pete)(Pete Johnson (musician))'s 1939 single \"['Em Pete](Roll)(Roll 'Em Pete)\", which is regarded as an important precursor of rock and roll.[Tosches](Nick)(Nick Tosches), ''Unsung Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll*, Secker & Warburg, 1991, Peter J. Silvester, *A Left Hand Like God: a history of boogie-woogie piano* (1989), .M. Campbell, ed., *Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on* (Cengage Learning, 3rd edn, 2008), p. 99.  The 1940s saw the increased use of blaring horns (including saxophones), shouted lyrics and boogie-woogie beats in jazz-based music. During and immediately after [War II](World)(World War II), with shortages of fuel and limitations on audiences and available personnel, large jazz bands were less economical and tended to be replaced by smaller combos, using guitars, bass and drums.P. D. Lopes, *The rise of a jazz art world* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 132 In the same period, particularly on the [Coast](West)(West Coast of the United States) and in the [Midwest](Midwestern United States), the development of [blues](jump)(jump blues), with its guitar riffs, prominent beats and shouted lyrics, prefigured many later developments. In the documentary film *[Hail! Rock 'n' Roll](Hail!)(Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll)*, [Richards](Keith)(Keith Richards) proposes that [Berry](Chuck)(Chuck Berry) developed his brand of rock and roll by transposing the familiar two-note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric guitar, creating what is instantly recognizable as rock guitar. This proposal by Richards neglects the black guitarists who did the same thing before Berry, such as [Carter](Goree)(Goree Carter),Robert Palmer, \"Church of the Sonic Guitar\", pp. 13\u201338 in Anthony DeCurtis, Present Tense, Duke University Press, 1992, p. 19. .

Denton: Texas State Historical Association. [boogie](Country)(Country boogie) and [electric blues](Chicago)(Chicago blues) supplied many of the elements that would be seen as characteristic of rock and roll. Inspired by [blues](electric)(electric blues), Chuck Berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to rock and roll, and established the electric guitar as its centerpiece,Michael Campbell & James Brody, *Rock and Roll: An Introduction*, [pp. 110\u2013111](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&pg=PA110)  adapting his rock band instrumentation from the basic blues band instrumentation of a lead guitar, second chord instrument, bass and drums.Michael Campbell & James Brody, [*Rock and Roll: An Introduction''](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&pg=PA80), , pp. 80\u201381. In 2017, [Christgau](Robert)(Robert Christgau) declared that \"Chuck Berry did in fact invent rock 'n' roll\", explaining that this artist \"came the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together\".\n\nRock and roll arrived at a time of considerable technological change, soon after the development of the electric guitar, [amplifier](amplifier) and [microphone](microphone), and the [rpm record](45)(45 rpm record). There were also changes in the record industry, with the rise of independent labels like [Atlantic](Atlantic records), [Sun](Sun Records) and [Chess](Chess Records) servicing [audiences](niche)(niche market) and a similar rise of radio stations that played their music. It was the realization that relatively affluent white teenagers were listening to this music that led to the development of what was to be defined as rock and roll as a distinct genre. Because the development of rock and roll was an evolutionary process, no single record can be identified as unambiguously \"the first\" rock and roll record.[Dawson](Jim)(Jim Dawson) and Steve Propes, ''[Was The First Rock'n'Roll Record](What)(iarchive:whatwasfirstrock0000daws)'', 1992,  Contenders for the title of \"[rock and roll record](first)(first rock and roll record)\" include [Rosetta Tharpe](Sister)(Sister Rosetta Tharpe)'s \"[Things Happening Every Day](Strange)(Strange Things Happening Every Day)\" (1944), \"[All Right](That's)(That's All Right)\" by [Crudup](Arthur)(Arthur Crudup) (1946),  \"[It On Over](Move)(Move It On Over (song))\" by [Williams](Hank)(Hank Williams) (1947), \"[Fat Man](The)(The Fat Man (song))\" by [Domino](Fats)(Fats Domino) (1949), [Carter](Goree)(Goree Carter)'s \"[Awhile](Rock)(Rock Awhile)\" (1949),[Palmer](Robert)(Robert Palmer (writer)), \"Church of the Sonic Guitar\", pp. 13\u201338 in Anthony DeCurtis, *Present Tense*, [University Press](Duke)(Duke University Press), 1992, p. 19.  and [Preston](Jimmy)(Jimmy Preston)'s \"[the Joint](Rock)(Rock the Joint)\" (1949) (later [covered](cover version) by [Haley & His Comets](Bill)(Bill Haley & His Comets) in 1952),\n\n\"[88](Rocket)(Rocket 88)\" by [Brenston](Jackie)(Jackie Brenston) and his Delta Cats ([Turner](Ike)(Ike Turner) and his band [Kings of Rhythm](The)(Kings of Rhythm) and sung by Brenston), was recorded by [Phillips](Sam)(Sam Phillips) in March 1951. This is often cited as the first rock n' roll record.M. Campbell, ed., *Popular Music in America: and the Beat Goes on* (Boston, Massachusetts: Cengage Learning, 3rd ed., 2008), , pp. 157\u20138. In an interview however, Ike Turner offered this comment: \"I don't think that 'Rocket 88' is rock 'n' roll. I think that 'Rocket 88' is R&B, but I think 'Rocket 88' is the cause of rock and roll existing\".\n\n[[File:BillHaley.JPG|upright=1.05|thumb|[Haley](Bill)(Bill Haley) and his Comets performing in the 1954 Universal International film *Round Up of Rhythm*]]\n\nIn terms of its wide cultural impact across society in the US and elsewhere, [Haley](Bill)(Bill Haley (musician))'s \"[Around the Clock](Rock)(Rock Around the Clock)\", recorded in April 1954 but not a commercial success until the following year, is generally recognized as an important milestone, but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements of rock and roll can be clearly discerned.Robert Palmer, \"Rock Begins\", in *[Stone](Rolling)(Rolling Stone) Illustrated History of Rock and Roll*, 1976\/1980,  (UK edition), pp. 3\u201314.\n\nJournalist [Petridis](Alexis)(Alexis Petridis) argued that neither Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\" nor Presley's version of \"That's Alright Mama\" heralded a new genre: \"They were simply the first white artists' interpretations of a sound already well-established by black musicians almost a decade before. It was a raucous, driving, unnamed variant of rhythm and blues that came complete with lyrics that talked about rocking\".\n\nOther artists with early rock and roll hits included [Berry](Chuck)(Chuck Berry), [Diddley](Bo)(Bo Diddley), [Richard](Little)(Little Richard), [Lee Lewis](Jerry)(Jerry Lee Lewis), and [Vincent](Gene)(Gene Vincent).

The commission was chaired by [Thomas White](Sir)(Thomas White (merchant)), [Mayor of London](Lord)(Lord Mayor of London), and [Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk](Thomas)(Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk). Other members included [Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby](Edward)(Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby), and [Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath](John)(John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath). As was to be expected, all defendants were found guilty and sentenced to death. Jane's guilt, of having treacherously assumed the title and the power of the monarch, was evidenced by a number of documents she had signed as \"Jane the Quene\". Her sentence was to \"be burned alive on [Hill](Tower)(Tower Hill) or beheaded as the Queen pleases\" ([burning](Execution by burning#Historical usage) was the [English punishment](traditional)(Burning of women in England) for [treason](treason) committed by women).;  The [ambassador](imperial)(List of ambassadors of the Holy Roman Empire to England) reported to [V, Holy Roman Emperor](Charles)(Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor), that her life was to be spared.\n\n[[File:Lady Jane Grey letter as Queen.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Official letter of Lady Jane Grey signing herself as \"Jane the Quene\". [Temple Library](Inner)(Inner Temple Library), London]]\n\n[rebellion](Wyatt's)(Wyatt's rebellion) in January 1554 against [Mary's marriage plans](Queen)(wedding of Mary I of England and Philip of Spain) with [of Spain](Philip)(Philip II of Spain) sealed Jane's fate. Her father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and his two brothers joined the rebellion, and so the government decided to go through with the verdict against Jane and Guildford. Their execution was first scheduled for 9 February 1554, but was then postponed for three days to give Jane a chance to convert to the Catholic faith. Mary sent her chaplain [Feckenham](John)(John Feckenham) to Jane, who was initially not pleased about this. Though she would not give in to his efforts \"to save her soul\", she became friends with him and allowed him to accompany her to the scaffold.\n\nOn the morning of 12 February 1554, the authorities took Guildford from his rooms at the Tower of London to the public [execution](execution) place at Tower Hill, where he was beheaded. A horse and cart brought his remains back to the Tower, past the rooms where Jane was staying. Seeing her husband's corpse return, Jane is reported to have exclaimed: \"Oh, Guildford, Guildford.\" She was then taken out to [Green](Tower)(Tower Green), inside the Tower, to be beheaded. According to the account of her execution given in the anonymous *Chronicle of Queen Jane and of Two Years of Queen Mary*, which formed the basis for [Holinshed](Raphael)(Raphael Holinshed)'s depiction, Jane gave a speech upon ascending the scaffold:\n\nGood people, I am come hither to die, and by a law I am condemned to the same. The fact, indeed, against the Queen's highness was unlawful, and the consenting thereunto by me: but touching the procurement and desire thereof by me or on my behalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocency, before God, and the face of you, good Christian people, this day.\n\nWhile admitting to action considered unlawful, she declared that \"I do wash my hands thereof in innocence\". Jane then recited [51](Psalm)(Psalm 51) (*Have mercy upon me, O God*) in English, and handed her gloves and handkerchief to her maid. The executioner asked her forgiveness, which she granted him, pleading: \"I pray you dispatch me quickly.\" Referring to her head, she asked, \"Will you take it off before I lay me down?\", and the axeman answered: \"No, madam.\" She then blindfolded herself. Jane then failed to find the block with her hands, and cried, \"What shall I do? Where is it?\" Probably [Thomas Brydges](Sir)(Thomas Brydges), the Deputy Lieutenant of the Tower, helped her find her way. With her head on the block, Jane spoke the last words of Jesus as recounted by [Luke](Gospel of Luke): \"Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!\" The axe then fell and Jane was beheaded in one clean stroke.\n\nJane and Guildford are buried in the Chapel of [Peter ad Vincula](St)(Church of St Peter ad Vincula) on the north side of Tower Green. No memorial stone was erected at their grave. Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, was executed 11 days after Jane, on 23 February 1554. Her mother, the Duchess of Suffolk, married her Master of the Horse and [chamberlain](Chamberlain (office)), [Stokes](Adrian)(Adrian Stokes (Master of Horse)), in March 1555. She was fully pardoned by Mary and allowed to live at Court with her two surviving daughters. She died in 1559.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Lady Jane Grey was imprisoned in the Tower of London before her execution.

He began writing the script when he was 16, though the film was not released in cinemas until he was 38. The original story was set in the year 2300 and was about a \"nobody\" named Zaltman Bleros (later renamed Korben Dallas) who wins a trip to the [Med](Club)(Club Med) resort on the planet Fhloston Paradise in the Angel constellation. There, he meets Leeloo, a \"sand-girl\" who has the \"beauty of youth\" despite being over 2,000 years old.\n\nBesson continued to work on the story for years. By 1991, when his documentary film *[Atlantis](Atlantis (1991 film))* was released, he had a 400-page script. Nicolas Seydoux and [Ledoux](Patrice)(Patrice Ledoux) from [Gaumont](Gaumont Film Company) were the first people to take on the project. In November 1991, while looking for actors for the film, Besson met [comics](French)(Franco-Belgian comics) creators [Giraud](Jean)(Jean Giraud) and [M\u00e9zi\u00e8res](Jean-Claude)(Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res) and recruited them for the film's production design. Giraud and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res's comics inspired the look that Besson wanted for his futuristic [York City](New)(New York City).\n\nM\u00e9zi\u00e8res had designed *[Circles of Power](The)(The Circles of Power)* (1994), which contains a character named S'Traks, who drives a flying taxicab through the congested air of the vast metropolis on the planet Rubanis. M\u00e9zi\u00e8res showed images of the flying taxi to Besson, who was inspired to change character Korben Dallas's background from a worker in a rocket-ship factory to a taxi driver who flies his cab around a Rubanis-inspired futuristic New York City. Besson's production also hired five other artists for the project. In addition, the noted fashion designer [Gaultier](Jean-Paul)(Jean-Paul Gaultier) was hired to create the costumes. The team spent a year creating more than 8,000 drawings.\n\nDuring this time, Besson approached both [Willis](Bruce)(Bruce Willis) and [Gibson](Mel)(Mel Gibson) for the lead role. Willis expressed interest, though he was reluctant to take on the role as the film was considered risky after his previous two films, *[Hawk](Hudson)(Hudson Hawk)* and *[Bathgate](Billy)(Billy Bathgate (film))*, had been received poorly. Gibson eventually turned down the role. While the production team impressed film companies with their designs, they struggled to find one willing to take on a budget approaching nearly $100million. In December 1992, production stopped without any prior warning, and the team disbanded.\n\n[[File:Fifth Element Circles of Power.png|thumb|alt=screenshot of a flying taxi in the film, placed above a drawing of a flying taxi from a comic book|Korben's flying [taxicab](taxicab) (top), which was inspired by the comic album *[Circles of Power](The)(The Circles of Power)*, drawn by artist [M\u00e9zi\u00e8res](Jean-Claude)(Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res).]]\n\nBesson wrote and directed the commercially successful film *[The Professional](L\u00e9on:)(L\u00e9on: The Professional)* (1994). During that period, he continued to work on the script for *The Fifth Element*, shortening it. He reduced the film's budget to $90million before again attempting to find a studio willing to produce it. [Pictures](Columbia)(Columbia Pictures), which had a partnership in *Leon*, agreed to finance the film. By this time, Besson had decided to go with a lesser-known lead actor to save on production costs. Besson happened to be in [Josephson](Barry)(Barry Josephson)'s office when Willis called regarding a different film. Besson asked to speak to Willis \"just to say hello\", and told him that *The Fifth Element* was finally going ahead, explaining his decision to go with a less-expensive actor. After a short silence, Willis said, \"If I like the film, we can always come to an arrangement.\" After reading the script, Willis agreed to take on the role.\n\nProduction began in early August 1995. Besson traveled to various places for casting, including Paris, London and Rome. He hired [Oldman](Gary)(Gary Oldman) (who had starred in *L\u00e9on*) for the role of Zorg, describing Oldman as \"one of the top five actors in the world\".\n\nFor the character Leeloo, Besson chose [Jovovich](Milla)(Milla Jovovich) from the 200 to 300 applicants he met in person. The \"Divine Language\" spoken by Leeloo is a [language](fictional)(fictional language) of 400 words, invented by Besson. To practice, Jovovich and Besson held conversations and wrote letters to each other in the language. Besson was then married to [Ma\u00efwenn](Ma\u00efwenn) Le Besco, who played the role of Diva Plavalaguna when filming began. He left her to take up with Jovovich during filming. Jovovich and Besson later married but divorced two years later in 1999.\n\nAlthough he wanted to shoot the film in France, Besson could not find suitable facilities and filmed in London. It was primarily filmed at [Studios](Pinewood)(Pinewood Studios) on seven soundstages including the [Stage](007)(007 Stage). Construction of sets began in October 1995. The opera scene was filmed at the [Opera House](Royal)(Royal Opera House). Scenes depicted as being in Egypt were filmed in [Mauritania](Mauritania); the first shoot, a background shot of the desert, occurred there on 5 January 1996. Filming with actors began in late January, and was completed 21 weeks later. Willis finished filming on 16 May, while Oldman only commenced filming the following week; the protagonist (Korben) and antagonist (Zorg) never actually share any screen time. Despite being filmed in London, *The Fifth Element* was a French production, the costliest European film ever made at the time.\n\nThe designs of buildings in New York were derived from both [metabolist](Metabolism (architecture))-inspired masses of modular apartments from the 1960s and the futuristic designs of architect [Sant'Elia](Antonio)(Antonio Sant'Elia) in the 1910s. Besson demanded that most of the action shots take place in broad daylight, as he was reportedly tired of the dark spaceship corridors and dimly lit planets common in science-fiction films, and wanted a brighter, \"cheerfully crazy\" look as opposed to a gloomy, realistic one.\n\nGaultier designed each of the 900 costumes worn by extras in the Fhloston Paradise scenes and checked each costume every morning. His designs, described as \"intellectually [transgressive](Transgressive art)\",Hayward, p. 96. were said to challenge sexuality and gender norms. A single jacket he designed for the film cost $5,000. Jovovich's costume worn from when her character was first revived was inspired by typical hospital dressing and bandages that provided minimal modesty.\n\nThe original name of the character Ruby Rhod was Loc Rhod, which appears both in the original script and in the novel adapted from the film. Hayward speculated that the name change was a play on data in the periodic table. [Rubidium](Rubidium) is the first of the [element](period&nbsp;5)(period&nbsp;5 element)s, and exactly halfway along that row is the element [rhodium](rhodium). Using the first half of each element yields \"Rubi Rhod\". Others have speculated this name is a play on the character's [gender-bending](gender bender) persona, with a feminine first name and phallic surname. [Prince](Prince (musician)) was cast to portray Rhod but could not schedule filming around his touring dates. Chris Tucker and [Foxx](Jamie)(Jamie Foxx) were each considered for the role; Besson liked Foxx but felt that Tucker's smaller body suited the character better.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The director of the 1997 science fiction film *The Fifth Element* is **Luc Besson**.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":5847.3773002625,"scoring_ms":562.4153614044,"total_ms":6414.8049354553,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Luc Besson","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Women may derive pleasure from one part of the vagina, or from a feeling of closeness and fullness during vaginal penetration. Because the vagina is not rich in nerve endings, women often do not receive sufficient sexual stimulation, or [orgasm](orgasm), solely from vaginal penetration. Although the literature commonly cites a greater concentration of nerve endings and therefore greater sensitivity near the vaginal entrance (the outer one-third or lower third), some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation indicate no single area with a greater density of nerve endings. Other research indicates that only some women have a greater density of nerve endings in the anterior vaginal wall. Because of the fewer nerve endings in the vagina, childbirth pain is significantly more tolerable.\n\nPleasure can be derived from the vagina in a variety of ways. In addition to [penile](Human penis) penetration, pleasure can come from [masturbation](masturbation), [fingering](Fingering (sexual act)), [sex](oral)(oral sex) ([cunnilingus](cunnilingus)), or specific [position](sex)(sex position)s (such as the [position](missionary)(missionary position) or the [sex position](spoons)(spoons sex position)). Heterosexual couples may engage in cunnilingus or fingering as forms of [foreplay](foreplay) to incite sexual arousal or as accompanying acts, or as a type of [control](birth)(birth control), or to [virginity](preserve)(Virginity#Definitions of virginity loss).See [272](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&pg=PT290)  and [page 301](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&pg=PT321)  for two different definitions of outercourse (first of the pages for no-penetration definition; second of the pages for no-penile-penetration definition).  Less commonly, they may use non penile-vaginal sexual acts as a primary means of sexual pleasure. In contrast, [lesbian](lesbian)s and other [who have sex with women](women)(women who have sex with women) commonly engage in cunnilingus or fingering as [forms of sexual activity](main)(Lesbian sexual practices). Some women and couples use [toys](sex)(sex toys), such as a [vibrator](Vibrator (sex toy)) or [dildo](dildo), for vaginal pleasure. The *[Sutra](Kama)(Kama Sutra)*&nbsp;\u2013 an ancient [Hindu](Hindu) text written by [V\u0101tsy\u0101yana](V\u0101tsy\u0101yana), which includes a number of sexual positions&nbsp;\u2013 may also be used to increase sexual pleasure, with special emphasis on female sexual satisfaction.\n\nMost women require direct stimulation of the [clitoris](clitoris) to orgasm. The clitoris plays a part in vaginal stimulation. It is a sex organ of multiplanar structure containing an abundance of nerve endings, with a broad attachment to the pubic arch and extensive supporting tissue to the labia. Research indicates that it forms a tissue cluster with the vagina. This tissue is perhaps more extensive in some women than in others, which may contribute to orgasms experienced vaginally.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDuring sexual arousal, and particularly the stimulation of the clitoris, the walls of the vagina lubricate. This begins after ten to thirty seconds of sexual arousal, and increases in amount the longer the woman is aroused. It reduces friction or injury that can be caused by insertion of the penis into the vagina or other penetration of the vagina during sexual activity. The vagina lengthens during the arousal, and can continue to lengthen in response to pressure; as the woman becomes fully aroused, the vagina expands in length and width, while the cervix retracts. With the upper two-thirds of the vagina expanding and lengthening, the uterus rises into the [pelvis](greater)(greater pelvis), and the cervix is elevated above the vaginal floor, resulting in tenting of the mid-vaginal plane. This is known as the tenting or ballooning effect.  As the elastic walls of the vagina [or contract](stretch)(Vaginal contraction), with support from the pelvic muscles, to wrap around the inserted penis (or other object), this creates friction for the penis and helps to cause a man to experience orgasm and [ejaculation](ejaculation), which in turn enables [fertilization](fertilization).\n\nAn area in the vagina that may be an [zone](erogenous)(erogenous zone) is the [G-spot](G-spot). It is typically defined as being located at the anterior wall of the vagina, a couple or few inches in from the entrance, and some women experience intense pleasure, and sometimes an orgasm, if this area is stimulated during sexual activity. A G-spot orgasm may be responsible for [ejaculation](female)(female ejaculation), leading some doctors and researchers to believe that G-spot pleasure comes from the [gland](Skene's)(Skene's gland)s, a female [homologue](Homology (biology)) of the [prostate](prostate), rather than any particular spot on the vaginal wall; other researchers consider the connection between the Skene's glands and the G-spot area to be weak. The G-spot's existence (and existence as a distinct structure) is still under dispute because reports of its location can vary from woman to woman, it appears to be nonexistent in some women, and it is hypothesized to be an extension of the clitoris and therefore the reason for orgasms experienced vaginally.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The gland in females that is a homologue of the male prostate and is implicated in the debated existence of the G-spot is the **Skene's gland**. \n\nResearch suggests that the G-spot's existence and the pleasure associated with its stimulation may be linked to the Skene's glands, which are considered a female homologue of the prostate. However, the connection between the Skene's glands and the G-spot remains debated, as some studies indicate that the G-spot may be an extension of the clitoris rather than a distinct structure.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":8492.0177459717,"scoring_ms":490.5152320862,"total_ms":8982.6917648315,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Skene's gland","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Introduced in his first appearance as Kevin Healy, his name was soon changed to [David](List of Roseanne characters#David Healy). After a few more guest shots, Galecki was named a permanent *Roseanne* cast member from the fall of 1992 onward, after the cancellation of *Billy*. He would remain in the role of David Healy until the end of *Roseanne*'s run in 1997, with the character eventually marrying Darlene and fathering two children with her. Galecki's character on *The Big Bang Theory* would also have a short-lived relationship with Gilbert's character on the same show.\n\nGalecki also appeared in the 1995 music video for the [Matthews Band](Dave)(Dave Matthews Band) song \"[Satellite](Satellite (Dave Matthews Band song))\".\n\nAfter *Roseanne* ended, Galecki had small roles in a string of films, including the 1997 summer [film](slasher)(slasher film) *[Know What You Did Last Summer](I)(I Know What You Did Last Summer)* (as the killer's first victim),  *[Bean](Bean (film))* (1997), *[Opposite of Sex](The)(The Opposite of Sex)* (1998), *[Bounce](Bounce (film))* (2000) and *[Sky](Vanilla)(Vanilla Sky)* (2001).

He stayed in the role for the play's [Broadway](Broadway theater) run at the [Theatre](Cort)(Cort Theatre) in late 2006 and early 2007. Galecki said at the time, \"At its core, the play is about what we all sacrifice to be successful, whatever our careers or goals.\" The play was a commercial and critical success, and Galecki won a [Theater World Award](2007)(Theater World Award#2007) for his performance.\n\n[[File:Johnny Galecki at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Galecki at [PaleyFest](PaleyFest) 2013]]\n\nGalecki played [Hofstadter](Leonard)(Leonard Hofstadter) in the [CBS](CBS) sitcom *[Big Bang Theory](The)(The Big Bang Theory)*, which ran from 2007 to 2019 and was, for most of its run, among the top three most popular television comedies in the US. Galecki was originally asked to play the role of [Cooper](Sheldon)(Sheldon Cooper), but he felt he was better suited for the role of Leonard, and Sheldon's role was eventually given to [Parsons](Jim)(Jim Parsons). During the show's run, two of Galecki's former *Roseanne* co-stars appeared on the show: [Gilbert](Sara)(Sara Gilbert) (as [Winkle](Leslie)(Leslie Winkle), Leonard's colleague) and [Metcalf](Laurie)(Laurie Metcalf) (as Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mother).

The show, despite its high ratings, was cancelled after [Barr](Roseanne)(Roseanne Barr) posted a racist and controversial tweet about [Jarrett](Valerie)(Valerie Jarrett). *Roseanne* was replaced by a new program, *[Conners](The)(The Conners)*, which premiered in October 2018 and featured the same cast without Barr.

Two of Salesforce's earliest investors were [Ellison](Larry)(Larry Ellison), the co-founder and first CEO of Oracle, and [Minor](Halsey)(Halsey Minor), the founder of [CNET](CNET).\n\nSalesforce was severely affected by the [bubble](dot-com)(dot-com bubble) bursting at the beginning of the new millennium, with the company laying off 20% of its workforce. Despite its losses, Salesforce continued strong during the early 2000s. Salesforce also gained notability during this period for its \"the end of software\" tagline and marketing campaign, in which it also hired actors to hold up signs with its slogan outside a [Systems](Siebel)(Siebel Systems) conference. Salesforce's revenue continued to increase from 2000 to 2003, with 2003's revenue skyrocketing from $5.4 million in the fiscal year 2001 to over $100 million by December 2003.\n\nAlso in 2003, Salesforce held its first annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. In June 2004, the company had its [public offering](initial)(initial public offering) on the [York Stock Exchange](New)(New York Stock Exchange) under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110&nbsp;million. In 2006, Salesforce launched IdeaExchange, a platform that allows customers to connect with company product managers.\n\nIn 2009, Salesforce passed $1 billion in annual revenue. Also, in 2009, the company launched Service Cloud, an application that helps companies manage service conversations about their products and services.\n\nIn 2014, the company released Trailhead, a free online learning platform. In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform. In September 2016, Salesforce announced the launch of Einstein, an artificial intelligence platform that supports several of Salesforce's cloud services.\n\nIn 2019, Salesforce joined the [Jones Industrial Average](Dow)(Dow Jones Industrial Average), replacing energy giant and [Oil](Standard)(Standard Oil)-descendant [ExxonMobil](ExxonMobil). Salesforce's ascension to the Dow Jones was concurrent with that of [Amgen](Amgen) and [Honeywell](Honeywell). Because the Dow Jones factors its components by market price, Salesforce was the largest technology component of the index at its accession. CNN Business |url=https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/08\/31\/investing\/salesforce-dow\/index.html |access-date=2022-08-24 |website=CNN |language=en}}\n\nAcross 2020 and 2021, Salesforce saw some notable leadership changes; in February 2020, co-chief executive officer Keith Block stepped down from his position in the company. [Benioff](Marc)(Marc Benioff) remained as chairman and chief executive officer. Indianapolis News  Indiana Weather  Indiana Traffic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-28}} In February 2021, Amy Weaver, previously the chief legal officer, became CFO. Former CFO Mark Hawkins announced that he would be retiring in October. In November 2021, [Taylor](Bret)(Bret Taylor) was named vice chair and co-CEO of the company.\n\nIn December 2020, it was announced that Salesforce would acquire [Slack](Slack Technologies) for $27.7 billion, its largest acquisition to date. The acquisition closed in July 2021. Journalists covering the acquisition emphasized the price Salesforce paid for Slack, which was a 54% premium compared to Slack's market value, as too high of a premium for the company, with views varying from the premium being too concerning for investors to Salesforce playing the long game.\n\nIn August 2022, Salesforce reported second-quarter earnings of $7.72 billion. Upon the German software firm [SAP](SAP) reporting its earnings for the same quarter totaling \u20ac7.52 Billion, Acceleration Economy reported that Salesforce had surpassed SAP to become the world's largest enterprise software vendor. This mirrored Benioff's remarks in Salesforce's earnings call, where he stated he looked at \"this quarter very much as kind of a milestone\".\n\nSalesforce announced a partnership with [Platforms](Meta)(Meta Platforms) in September 2022. The deal called that Meta's consumer application [WhatsApp](WhatsApp) would integrate Salesforce's Customer 360 platform to allow consumers to communicate with companies directly. Seeking Alpha |url=https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/news\/3884560-meta-platforms-announces-whatsapp-salesforce-integration-to-let-businesses-chat-with-customers |access-date=2022-09-20 |website=seekingalpha.com |date=September 20, 2022 |language=en}}\n\nIn November 2022, Salesforce announced it would terminate employees in its sales organization. *[Protocol](Politico#Protocol)* reported that the company would likely eliminate some 2500 jobs.\n\nIn November 2022, Salesforce announced its co-CEO and vice chair, Bret Taylor, would be stepping down from his roles at the end of January 2023, with Benioff continuing to run the company and serve as board chair. Within the week, former [Tableau](Tableau Software) CEO Mark Nelson and former [Slack](Slack (software)) CEO [Butterfield](Stewart)(Stewart Butterfield) also announced their departures. When asked about the departures, Benioff stated, \"people come and people go\"; Salesforce's stock dropped to a 52-week low after Nelson's resignation. Seeking Alpha |url=https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/news\/3914027-salesforce-crashes-to-52-week-low-as-slack-boss-butterfield-departs |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=seekingalpha.com |date=December 5, 2022 |language=en}}\n\nIn January 2023, the company announced a [layoff](layoff) of about 10% or approximately 8,000 positions. According to Benioff, the company hiring too aggressively during the [pandemic](COVID-19)(COVID-19 pandemic) and the increase in working from home led to the layoff. The company will also reduce office space as part of the restructuring plan. The same month brought an announcement from [investor](activist)(activist investor) [Management](Elliott)(Elliott Investment Management) that it would acquire a \"big stake\" in the company.

When rapper Notorious B.I.G. was killed in 1997, Duncan quit the personal-protection business.\n\nAfter having begun his career with several bit parts playing bouncers in films such as *[Bulworth](Bulworth)* and *[Night at the Roxbury](A)(A Night at the Roxbury)*, Duncan came to prominence when he was cast as Bear in the blockbuster [Bay](Michael)(Michael Bay) action film *[Armageddon](Armageddon (1998 film))* (1998). During the production of the film, Duncan became friends with castmate [Willis](Bruce)(Bruce Willis), and it was Willis' influence that helped him to get his breakout role as gentle giant John Coffey in the [Darabont](Frank)(Frank Darabont) film *[Green Mile](The)(The Green Mile (film))* (1999).

In July 2006, Duncan showed interest in returning for the role of the Kingpin, but stated that he would not be willing to regain the weight that he had lost. In 2009, he stopped eating meat and later appeared in a [PETA](People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) ad campaign, touting the health benefits and his increased strength from a [diet](vegetarian)(vegetarianism).\"[Green Mile Star Joins Veggie Campaign](http:\/\/www.kshb.com\/dpp\/entertainment\/celebrity\/Green-Mile-star-joins-veggie-campaign_23162602)\" , KSHB.com, May 12, 2012.\n\nIn 2005, Duncan appeared in *[Island](The)(The Island (2005 film))* and *[City](Sin)(Sin City (film))*, in which he played Manute, a powerful mobster.

Most notably, in April 2011, Duncan guest-starred on an episode of TV series *[Bones](Bones (TV series))* as Leo Knox which, in 2012, led to Duncan's receiving his first starring role as the same character in the spinoff series *[Finder](The)(The Finder (U.S. TV series))*.

Realizing that they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N' Roses, they decided to form a new band together. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist [Stradlin](Izzy)(Izzy Stradlin) was initially involved, but left after the others decided to find a lead singer. [Kushner](Dave)(Dave Kushner), who had previously played with McKagan in [Loaded](Loaded (band)), then joined the band on rhythm guitar. For many months, the four searched for a lead singer by listening to offered demo tapes, a monotonous process documented by [VH1](VH1). Eventually, former [Temple Pilots](Stone)(Stone Temple Pilots) vocalist [Weiland](Scott)(Scott Weiland) joined the band.\n\nIn 2003, Velvet Revolver played several concerts during the summer and released their first single, \"[Me Free](Set)(Set Me Free (Velvet Revolver song))\". In June 2004, they released their debut album, *[Contraband](Contraband (Velvet Revolver album))*, which debuted at No.1 on the U.S. chart and sold two million copies, re-establishing Slash as a mainstream performer. A year-and-a-half-long tour followed in support of the album. In 2005, the band was nominated for three Grammy Awards: Rock Album of the Year, Rock Song, and Hard Rock Performance for their *Contraband* single \"[Slither](Slither (song))\" which won their first and only Grammy. In July 2007, Velvet Revolver released their second album, *[Libertad](Libertad (Velvet Revolver album))*, and embarked on a second tour. During a show in March 2008, Weiland announced to the audience that it would be the band's final tour; he was fired from the band in April 2008 and Slash insisted \"chemical issues\" led to the split. The following month Weiland rejoined Stone Temple Pilots. Despite Weiland's departure, Velvet Revolver did not officially disband.\n\nIn early 2010, Velvet Revolver began writing new songs and auditioning new singers.
