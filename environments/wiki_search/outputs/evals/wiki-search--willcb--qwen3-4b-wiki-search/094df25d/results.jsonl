Remains of several major cities can be found in Delhi. The first of these was in the southern part of present-day Delhi. King [Pal](Anang)(Anangpal Tomar) of the [dynasty](Tomara)(Tomara dynasty) built [Kot](Lal)(Qila Rai Pithora) and several temples in 1052 CE.

[Aibak](Qutb-ud-din)(Qutb al-Din Aibak), was given the responsibility of governing the conquered territories of India after Ghori returned to his capital, [Ghor](Ghor Province). When Ghori died without an heir in 1206 CE,  Qutb-ud-din assumed control of Ghori's Indian possessions, and laid the foundation of the [Sultanate](Delhi)(Delhi Sultanate) and the [dynasty](Mamluk)(Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)). He began construction of the [Minar](Qutb)(Qutb Minar) and [Quwwat-al-Islam](Qutb complex) (Might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India. It was his successor, [Iltutmish](Iltutmish) (1211\u20131236), who consolidated the Turkic conquest of northern India.

They built several forts and townships that are part of the [cities of Delhi](seven)(History of Delhi). Delhi was a major centre of [Sufism](Sufism) during this period. The [Sultanate (Delhi)](Mamluk)(Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)) was overthrown in 1290 by [ud din Firuz Khalji](Jalal)(Jalal-ud-din Khalji) (1290\u20131320). Under the second Khalji ruler, [Khalji](Ala-ud-din)(Alauddin Khalji), the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the [River](Narmada)(Narmada River) in the Deccan. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of [bin Tughluq](Muhammad)(Muhammad bin Tughluq) (1325\u20131351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to [Maharashtra](Daulatabad,)(Daulatabad, Maharashtra) in central India. However, by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of [Shah Tughlaq](Firoz)(Firoz Shah Tughlaq) (1351\u20131388), the [Sultanate](Delhi)(Delhi Sultanate) rapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces.

Under the Afghan [dynasty](Lodi)(Lodi dynasty) (1451\u20131526), the Delhi sultanate recovered control of Punjab and the Gangetic plain to once again achieve domination over Northern India.

In a statement given to *[Technica](Ars)(Ars Technica)*, Bethesda said that the breach occurred via \"an error with our customer support website\" and that they are \"investigating the incident and will provide additional updates as we learn more\". The publisher clarified that the only information leaked were details that the support site would have requested, rather than credit card numbers or passwords, and that they would notify all affected customers.\n\nIn 2018, Bethesda partnered with the Silver Screen Bottling Company to create \"Nuka Dark Rum\", an alcoholic beverage based on the in-game \"Nuka-Cola Dark\" introduced in the *[4: Nuka-World](Fallout)(Fallout 4: Nuka-World)* [add-on](Downloadable content). The rum was available to be pre-ordered in August 2018 for . While its release was expected to coincide with the launch of *Fallout 76*, the rum was delayed and was shipped instead in late December 2018. Upon receiving it, fans criticized the fact that the rum bottle advertised, previously expected to be a bottle in the missile-like shape of the in-game Nuka-Cola item, had turned out to be a standard glass bottle encased in a large plastic cover. The rum's asking price of $80 was subsequently condemned from expectations that the design would be of high quality, since none of the marketing had stated what the bottles would be made of.\n\nIn September 2019, collectible \"Nuka Cola\"\u2013themed *Fallout* helmets produced by Chronicle Collectibles, of which only 32 of the 20,000 manufactured were sold, were recalled by the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](U.S.)(U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) due to containing high levels of mold and posing a health risk. No incidents or injuries were reported. [GameStop](GameStop), which sold the helmets, notified all customers who had purchased a helmet and offered them a full refund.\n\nIn June 2022, a *Kotaku* article published reports from ten anonymous former employees of Bethesda and its parent company [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) of severe mismanagement during *Fallout 76*s development. The reports claimed that [crunch](Crunch (video games)) had been enforced, leading to an \"exodus\" of senior developers from the company. The loss of staff led to Bethesda borrowing developers working on [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios)' *[Redfall](Redfall)* and Bethesda's *[Starfield](Starfield (video game))* to assist with *Fallout 76*. Other alleged issues included technical problems with the game's design and engine, as well as these concerns being ignored by senior management. The sources expressed cynicism towards an improvement of working conditions at Bethesda (following their acquisition by Microsoft), saying \"It would be great if something like [ABetterABK](ABK Workers Alliance) existed for Bethesda [...] But everyone is terrified...because [Bethesda] HR is super cutthroat.\"\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The controversy involving the Fallout 76 Power Armor special edition's physical item centered on the inclusion of a nylon duffel bag instead of the advertised canvas bag. Bethesda initially claimed the change was due to material unavailability and stated they would take no action, which drew criticism for not informing customers beforehand. The bag's description on Bethesda's website only changed to \"nylon\" after complaints were submitted. In response, Bethesda offered affected customers 500 atoms of in-game currency as compensation, which was deemed insufficient since the in-game postman uniform (which includes a canvas bag) costs 700 atoms. Additionally, it was revealed that Bethesda had produced and given away canvas bags to influencers, further fueling fan outrage.

For example, \"Cassilda's Song\" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:\"The King in Yellow\" in e.g.\n\nThe short story \"The Mask\" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:\"The Mask\" in e.g.\n\nIt is also stated, in \"The Repairer of Reputations\", that the final moment of the first act involves the character Camilla's \"agonized scream and [...] awful words echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa\".\n\nAll of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the \"irresistible\" revealed truths: \"The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect\". Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: \"If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it\" (\"[Repairer of Reputations](The)(The Repairer of Reputations)\").\n\nChambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from \"The Repairer of Reputations\":\n\nHe mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. \"The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever\", he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.\n\nA similar passage occurs in \"The Yellow Sign\", in which two protagonists have read *The King in Yellow*:\n\nNight fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The fictional play that recurs as a motif in some stories of *The King in Yellow* is *The King in Yellow*.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":4070.4836845398,"scoring_ms":827.8112411499,"total_ms":4903.1920433044,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"The King in Yellow","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

''Bob's Burgers'' first season averaged 5.07 million viewers in the [television season](2010\u201311)(2010\u201311 United States network television schedule), with the season's first episode, \"[Flesh](Human)(Human Flesh (Bob's Burgers))\", being the highest-rated new series premiere of the television season. The second season of ''Bob's Burgers* averaged 4.18 million viewers, as part of the [television season](2011\u201312)(2011\u201312 United States network television schedule) and the third season consisted of an average of 4.11 million views per episode in the [television season](2012\u201313)(2012\u201313 United States network television schedule).  The first season consisted of 13 episodes, the second consisted of 9, the third consisted of 23, the fourth consisted of 22, the fifth consisted of 21, the sixth consisted of 19, the seventh consisted of 22, the eighth consisted of 21, and the ninth season onwards consists of 22. While season 1 received mostly mixed reviews, since season 2, *Bob's Burgers'' has received positive reviews from critics.\n\nOn January 26, 2023, Fox renewed the show for 14th and 15th production cycles.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The show *Bob's Burgers* is broadcast by the Fox Broadcasting Company.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":5131.0687065125,"scoring_ms":570.4786777496,"total_ms":5703.3703327179,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Fox Broadcasting Company","total_tool_calls":4.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":2.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

In 1783, [Jos\u00e9](Juan Jos\u00e9 Elhuyar) and [Elhuyar](Fausto)(Fausto Elhuyar) found an acid made from [wolframite](wolframite) that was identical to tungstic acid.

British authorities acted in 1912 to free the [mine](Carrock)(Carrock Fell) from the German owned Cumbrian Mining Company and, during [War I](World)(World War I), restrict German access elsewhere. In [War II](World)(World War II), tungsten played a more significant role in [political dealings.](background)(Wolfram Crisis) Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was [under pressure from both sides](put)(Portugal during World War II#Wolfram (Tungsten)), because of its deposits of wolframite ore at [Panasqueira](Panasqueira). Tungsten's desirable properties such as resistance to high temperatures, its hardness and density, and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry, both as a constituent of weapons and equipment and employed in production itself, e.g., in [carbide](tungsten)(tungsten carbide) cutting tools for machining steel.\n\nNow tungsten is used in many more applications such as aircraft & motorsport ballast weights, darts, anti-vibration tooling, and sporting equipment.\n\nTungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings. In 1928, a US court rejected [Electric](General)(General Electric)'s attempt to patent it, overturning  granted in 1913 to [D. Coolidge](William)(William D. Coolidge).General Electric Co. v.

[AMD](AMD) for desktop, mobile, server, and embedded platforms based on the [microarchitecture](Zen)(Zen (microarchitecture)). It consists of [processing unit](central)(central processing unit)s (CPUs) marketed for mainstream, enthusiast, server, and workstation segments and [processing units](accelerated)(AMD Accelerated Processing Unit) (APUs) marketed for mainstream and entry-level segments and [system](embedded)(embedded system)s applications.\n\nAMD announced a new series of processors on December 13, 2016, named \"Ryzen\", and delivered them in Q1 2017, the first of several generations. The 1000 series featured up to eight cores and 16 threads, with a 52% [per cycle](instructions)(instructions per cycle) (IPC) increase over their prior CPU products. The second generation of Ryzen processors, the Ryzen 2000 series, released in April 2018, featured the [Zen+](Zen+) microarchitecture, a [12&nbsp;nm](Die shrink#Half-shrink) process ([GlobalFoundries](GlobalFoundries)); the aggregate performance increased 10% (of which approximately 3% was IPC, 6% was frequency); most importantly, Zen+ fixed the cache and memory latencies that had been major weak points (for latency-sensitive workloads, IPC gains of nearly \u224810%). The third generation of Ryzen processors launched on July 7, 2019, based on AMD's [2](Zen)(Zen 2) architecture, featuring significant design improvements with a 15% average IPC boost, a doubling of floating point capability to a full 256 bit wide execution datapath much like [Intel](Intel)'s [Haswell](Haswell (microarchitecture)) released in 2014, a shift to an [MCM](Multi-chip module) style \"chiplet\" based package design, and a further shrink to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's ([TSMC](TSMC)) [nm](7)(7 nm process) fabrication process. On June 16, 2020, AMD announced new Ryzen 3000 series XT processors with 100 MHz higher boost clocks versus non XT processors. On October 8, 2020, AMD announced the Zen&nbsp;3 architecture for their Ryzen 5000 series processors, featuring a 19% [per cycle](instructions)(instructions per cycle) (IPC) improvement over Zen&nbsp;2, while being built on the same 7&nbsp;nm TSMC node with out-of-the-box operating boost frequencies exceeding 5&nbsp;GHz for the first time since AMD's Piledriver.Archived at [Ghostarchive](https:\/\/ghostarchive.org\/varchive\/youtube\/20211205\/iuiO6rqYV4o) and the [Wayback Machine](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201008030113\/https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iuiO6rqYV4o):  AMD Ryzen Desktop Processors |url=https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iuiO6rqYV4o |website=YouTube |language=en-US |access-date=November 28, 2022}} With the launch of Zen&nbsp;3 via the Ryzen 5000 series, AMD took the lead in gaming performance over Intel, particularly with single-threaded performance. This was followed by an unusually short stop-gap release of Ryzen 6000 mobile-only series processors on January 4, 2022, using the modestly changed Zen3+ core on a 6nm process by TSMC, with claims up to 15% performance uplift (typical 10% performance) gains (stated to be from frequency rather than IPC). Following this, the Ryzen 7000 series released on September 27, 2022, for desktops, featuring the new Zen4 core with a 13% uplift in IPC and 15% increase in frequency for a claimed nearly 30% in single thread performance. The Ryzen 7000 series features a brand new AM5 socket that only supports [SDRAM](DDR5)(DDR5 SDRAM), unlike AMD's previous DDR3 sockets like AM2\/+ and AM3\/+ that offered DDR2 and DDR3 options and Intel's Alder Lake platforms that offer both DDR4 and DDR5 compatibility.\n\nA majority of AMD's consumer Ryzen products use the [AM4](Socket)(Socket AM4) platform. In August 2017, AMD launched their Ryzen Threadripper line aimed at the enthusiast workstation market. AMD Ryzen Threadripper uses the larger [TR4](Socket TR4), [sTRX4](Socket sTRX4), and [sWRX8](Socket sWRX8) sockets, which support additional memory channels and [Express](PCI)(PCI Express) lanes. AMD has moved to the new [AM5](Socket)(Socket AM5) platform for consumer desktop Ryzen with the release of [4](Zen)(Zen 4) products in late 2022.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-f56be2a3d3ce4634b3a370c1d7965351\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"ryzen:history\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"## History\n\nRyzen uses the \"Zen\" CPU microarchitecture, a complete original redesign by AMD that returned it to the high-end CPU market after a decade of near-total absence since 2006. AMD's primary competitor [Intel](Intel) had largely dominated this market segment starting from the 2006 release of their [microarchitecture](Core)(Intel Core (microarchitecture)) and the Core 2 Duo. Similarly, Intel had abandoned the [4](Pentium)(Pentium 4), as its [NetBurst](NetBurst) microarchitecture was uncompetitive with AMD's [XP](Athlon)(Athlon #Athlon\u00a0XP (2001\u20132003)) in terms of price and efficiency, and with [64](Athlon)(Athlon 64) & [X2](64)(Athlon 64 x2) they were outcompeted.  Even an upgraded version of the prior [3](Pentium)(Pentium 3) continues to underpin Intel's CPU designs to this very day.\n\nUntil Ryzen's initial launch in 2017, Intel's market dominance over AMD would only continue to increase as simultaneously with the above top-to-bottom launch of the now famous \"Intel Core\" CPU lineup and branding, and the successful roll out of their well known [\"tick-tock\"](Tick\u2013tock model) CPU release strategy. This brand new release strategy was most famous for alternating between a new CPU microarchitecture and a new fabrication node each and every year; with it becoming a release cadence Intel stuck to for almost an entire decade (specifically lasting from Intel Core's initial Q3 2006 launch with 65 nm Conroe, all the way until their 14 nm [Broadwell](Broadwell (microarchitecture)) desktop CPUs were delayed a year from a planned 2014 launch out to Q3 2015 instead. This necessitated a refresh of their pre-existing 22 nm [Haswell](Haswell (microarchitecture)) CPU lineup in the form of \"Devil's Canyon\", and thus officially ended \"tick-tock\" as a practice). These events were incredibly important for AMD, as Intel's inability to further sustain \"tick-tock\" around 2014 would prove essential in providing both the initial and continually growing market openings for their Ryzen CPUs and the Zen CPU microarchitecture to succeed.\n\nAlso of note is the release of AMD's [microarchitecture](Bulldozer)(Bulldozer (microarchitecture)) in 2011, which despite being a clean sheet CPU design like Zen, had been designed and optimized for [computing](parallel)(parallel computing) above all else, leading to starkly inferior real-world performance in any workload that was not highly [threaded](Thread (computing)). This caused it to be uncompetitive in primarily every area outside of raw multithread performance and its use in low power APUs with integrated [Radeon](Radeon) graphics. Despite a die shrink and several revisions of the Bulldozer architecture, performance and power efficiency failed to catch up with Intel's competing products. Consequently, all of this forced AMD to abandon the entire high-end CPU market (including [desktop](Desktop computer), [laptop](laptop)s, and [server](Server (computing))\/enterprise) until Ryzen's release in 2017.\n\nRyzen is the consumer-level implementation of the newer [microarchitecture](Zen)(Zen (microarchitecture)), a complete redesign that marked the return of AMD to the high-end CPU market, offering a product stack able to compete with Intel at every level. Having more processing cores, Ryzen processors offer greater multi-threaded performance at the same price point relative to Intel's Core processors. The Zen architecture delivers more than 52% improvement in [per cycle](instructions)(instructions per cycle) (clock) over the prior-generation Bulldozer AMD core, without raising power use. The changes to [set](instruction)(Instruction set architecture) also makes it [binary-compatible](Binary-code compatibility) with Intel's [Broadwell](Broadwell (microarchitecture)), smoothing the transition for users.\n\nThreadripper, which is geared for high end desktops (HEDT), was not developed as part of a business plan or a specific roadmap; instead, a small enthusiast team inside AMD saw an opportunity that something could be developed between the Ryzen and [Epyc](Epyc) CPU roadmaps that would put the crown of performance on AMD. After some progress was made in their spare time, the project was greenlit and put in an official roadmap by 2016.\n\nSince the release of Ryzen, AMD's CPU market share has increased while Intel's appears to have stagnated and\/or regressed.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-dbd1b2a873fd48a4a362988dab52cdc9\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"ryzen:ryzen_7000\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Ryzen 7000\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-cfa08be42051410fbc517035a6232ac5\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"ryzen:ryzen_7000\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Ryzen 7000\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-baaeccf5a9d9444c8f34f87d67913da0\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"ryzen:ryzen_7000\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Ryzen 7000\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-e9b3339256264bd689e139ed3a6b08aa\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"ryzen:ryzen_7000\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Ryzen 7000\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-445a094e965942c7ac48a6a181f6f0df\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"ryzen:ryzen_7000\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Ryzen 7000\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-7b5357f5865d4ef18f2a28b1d03064b3\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"ryzen:ryzen_7000\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]}],"task":"default","reward":0.0,"generation_ms":8834.912776947,"scoring_ms":8875.1535415649,"total_ms":17710.7810974121,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Raptor Lake","total_tool_calls":10.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":8.0,"judge_reward_func":0.0}

Before meeting Edward, Martin reveals to the warden, Moss, that he was brought in to fill in for Dr. Stewart, who was Edward's regular visitor for this procedure. Stewart had died by suicide the night before, causing Martin to replace him. Edward is scheduled to die via electrocution at his insistence that very day and Moss explains to Martin that Edward's fate depends upon Martin's diagnosis; if Martin deduces that Edward is sane, he will be executed, but if Martin declares him insane with multi-personality disorder as Stewart had believed, Edward will be spared.\n\nWhen Martin takes a seat to interrogate Edward, the inmate refuses to be identified as a human and instead a demon inhabiting Edward's body named \"Nefariamous,\" a name Satan gave him  \"Nefarious\" for short. Martin does not believe Nefarious is who he says he is and thinks instead that it is an act by Edward to seem insane; however, he is surprised when Nefarious insists that he wants to be executed, or rather, that he wants Edward to be executed. Nefarious also explains that before the day is over, Martin will commit three murders.\n\nMartin, an atheist, balks at this idea but plays along, asking Nefarious how he came to inhabit Edward. Nefarious explains that he possessed Edward through a process carried out through Edward\u2019s life, beginning with ease of access through Edward\u2019s never having been [baptized](baptized), continuing through seemingly innocuous events such as Edward\u2019s grandmother having given him a [board](ouija)(ouija board) as a present, allowing manipulative communication, finally completing the process only after Edward consented to the possession multiple times. Martin brings in a chaplain to confront the demon in Edward, which frightens Nefarious until he realizes that the priest does not believe in demons and therefore has no effect on him. Martin then asks to talk to Edward, causing Nefarious to recede and produce a timid, childlike Edward who is terribly distraught and shaken by his possession. Edward insists that he is possessed and that the demon had murdered multiple people using his innocent body as a vessel.\n\nWhen Martin begins probing further, Nefarious takes control and insists that Martin euthanized his terminally ill mother to acquire her massive wealth. Martin becomes angry and threatens to leave the meeting, but changes his mind. When Martin decides to write Nefarious off as insane, Nefarious explains that Martin's girlfriend is pregnant, and because Martin threatened to leave her, she is terminating her pregnancy. Overcome with curiosity, Martin begs a kindly prison guard for access to a phone, which he uses to call the health clinic from where he realizes his girlfriend has just finished with the abortion. Nefarious cackles with glee, explaining to Martin that \"all hell is rejoicing.\"\n\nMartin still remains doubtful Nefarious is possessed, but is fully intrigued to hear what the inmate has to tell him. After Martin insists that the world is reclaiming the moral high ground, Nefarious laughs before telling him there is currently an influx of slavery and human trafficking which the demons are helping with. Nefarious then explains he wants Martin to write a book called *The Dark Gospel*, which is his Satanic equivalent to the Bible and will begin another world religion in servitude to demons. Martin is called away by Warden Moss who reveals to him that upon searching Edward's prison cell, they found documentation of Martin's life as Nefarious had done with all his other victims, as well as the dark gospel which Edward wrote, crediting it to Martin's name. Martin, now believing Edward is faking split personalities, confronts Nefarious about this. Nefarious breaks his own hand to slip free of one of the cuffs and seizes Martin, threatening to break his neck unless Martin begs for his life. Overcome with terror, Martin begs Nefarious to spare him to which Nefarious complies before being beaten down by the prison guards. Instinctively, Martin declares that Edward is sane, but not before being warned by a triumphant Nefarious that he is condemning Edward to death.\n\nAs Edward is in the electric chair, Nefarious possesses his body for a final time, asking if Martin accepts his offer, to which Martin silently refuses. Disappointed, Nefarious leaves Edward's body, causing Edward to suffer an extremely painful and terrible death in the chair. The demon then tells Martin, \"You should have accepted my offer,\" before possessing him and trying to force Martin to commit suicide. However, Martin inadvertently prays to God for help, causing the gun to misfire and Nefarious to let go of him. One year later, a visibly changed Martin is shown promoting Nefarious' book  not as a \"dark gospel\" but as a rewritten cautionary tale for people to read and realize the demonic influence in society. On his way home, Martin bumps into a homeless woman whom Nefarious has now possessed.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The name of the demon possessing the death-row inmate in the film *Nefarious* is \"Nefariamous,\" commonly referred to as \"Nefarious.\"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":0.0,"generation_ms":6248.9011287689,"scoring_ms":343.7063694,"total_ms":6593.7044620514,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Nefarious","total_tool_calls":4.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":2.0,"judge_reward_func":0.0}

Both Dacus and Bridgers had opened for Baker on separate tours in 2016, and they all ran in similar circles as young up-and-coming performers navigating the [indie](Independent music) scene.\n\nThe three became close and shared their frustrations of constantly being compared to each other as \"[in rock](women)(women in rock)\" despite their considerably different musical styles. Dacus has commented that the idea of women in music \"should not be remarkable whatsoever,\" with Bridgers adding, \"it's not a genre.\" Each has spoken on the tendency of the music industry to pit women against each other, and the group was formed in part to reject this idea. \"I hope people see the three of us and know there isn't competition,\" Dacus has said. \"You don't have to compete with your contemporaries. You can make something good with people you admire.\"\n\nBaker had joked to Dacus years before about a \"pipe dream\" that they could one day all form a band.

At [2019](E3)(E3 2019), Xbox Game Studios announced it had acquired [Fine](Double)(Double Fine), and established a new internal studio dedicated to *Age of Empires* headed by Shannon Loftis, bringing their total studio count to fifteen. This studio, later named World's Edge, does not directly develop any games, but oversees efforts from external studios, such as [Entertainment](Relic)(Relic Entertainment), Forgotten Empires and [Media](Tantalus)(Tantalus Media), to assure the series is being developed in the right direction, according to creative director Adam Isgreen.\n\nBooty has stated that with studios like Obsidian, Ninja Theory, and Double Fine, which have traditionally supported multiplatform games, they will determine if it makes sense for their future products to be treated as Microsoft-exclusive content for Xbox and Windows computers, or to allow these to be published across multiple platforms. That decision will be based on a \"network effect\", whether having these games on other platforms will better support the franchise and thus worthwhile for Microsoft to help dedicate resources towards it, such as they had with *Minecraft*. Xbox Game Studios has allowed some of the content developed by its studios or that was previously published exclusively for the Xbox and Windows systems to be released on [Nintendo](Nintendo) systems, notably the [Switch](Nintendo)(Nintendo Switch) versions of *[Cuphead](Cuphead)* from Studio MDHR and *[and the Blind Forest](Ori)(Ori and the Blind Forest)* from Moon Studios, and allowing for the titular characters from Rare's *[Banjo-Kazooie](Banjo-Kazooie)* into *[Smash Bros. Ultimate](Super)(Super Smash Bros. Ultimate)*. However, the division stated that these releases were generally \"existing commitments to other platforms\" that they allowed studios to honor, but they otherwise have \"no plans to further expand our exclusive first party games to other consoles.\"\n\nNear the end of 2019, with the combined fifteen studios now under Xbox Game Studios, Booty stated that they now had more games than ever to handle, and were likely not going to acquire any additional studios in the near future, stating \"we've been shifting our focus inside Xbox Game Studios from acquisition and growth, to a phase of execution and delivery\". Additionally, as Microsoft started promotion of its fourth-generation of Xbox, including the [Series X](Xbox)(Xbox Series X), Booty stated that titles developed by Xbox Game Studios in year or two following its release will not be exclusively for the new generation of consoles, but instead will support both Xbox One and the new console, with some games receiving enhanced performance when played on the new console lineup. Booty said that with the large number of studios they had recently acquired, as well as ongoing external partnerships and their [Game Pass](Xbox)(Xbox Game Pass) service, the Studios are able to support a \"breadth of offerings in the portfolio\" designed to attract a large number of players. Further, in an interview in November 2020, Phil Spencer said during an interview regarding the future of the Xbox brand that he intends to put more focus on outputting [RPG](Role-playing video game)s, which had to that point been underserved.\n\nMicrosoft and [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) announced on September 21, 2020, that Microsoft planned to acquire ZeniMax and its family of studios, which include [Game Studios](Bethesda)(Bethesda Game Studios), [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios), [Software](id)(id Software), [MachineGames](MachineGames), [Gameworks](Tango)(Tango Gameworks), and [Online Studios](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Online Studios), for over  in cash. According to Spencer, the ZeniMax acquisition was intended to give Microsoft a large library of games known around the world, and to expand the library of Xbox Game Pass and [XCloud](XCloud). Both U.S. and European Union regulatory agencies approved the acquisition by early March 2021, and the acquisition was formally completed by March 9, 2021. The total price of the deal was $8.1 billion Bethesda Softworks, the primarily publisher for all of ZeniMax's games, remained as an operational unit under Microsoft with the acquisition and retained all its current leadership. With the acquisition, future games from the studios will be exclusive to Xbox consoles, but existing commitments to other platforms (such as Arkane Studios' *[Deathloop](Deathloop)* and Tango Gameworks' *[Tokyo](Ghostwire:)(Ghostwire: Tokyo)*, which are contractually exclusive to [5](PlayStation)(PlayStation 5)) will still be honored. Spencer stated that Game Pass was also fundamental driver for the acquisition. A preliminary injunction to block the acquisition had been sought in an ongoing class-action lawsuit that ZeniMax faced over *[4](Fallout)(Fallout 4)*, with the plaintiffs in the case arguing that Microsoft could shield ZeniMax's assets from damages should they be found liable after the acquisition. The ZeniMax Board of Directors was dissolved following the Microsoft purchase.\n\nOn January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire [Blizzard](Activision)(Activision Blizzard) in an all-cash deal valued at $68.7 billion. Microsoft stated that this acquisition would make it the third-largest gaming company by revenue, following [Tencent](Tencent) and [Sony](Sony). With the announcement, Microsoft also announced a major change to its corporate structure, with Phil Spencer becoming CEO of the new division Microsoft Gaming, with Matt Booty leading Xbox Game Studios under it. Once approved, Activision Blizzard will then become a subdivision of Microsoft Gaming.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The value of Microsoft's acquisition deal for ZeniMax Media in 2020 was $8.1 billion.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":6756.4384937286,"scoring_ms":539.90483284,"total_ms":7296.4520454407,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"$8.1 billion","total_tool_calls":4.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":2.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Directed by [Fowler](Jeff)(Jeff Fowler) (in his feature directorial debut) and written by [Casey](Pat)(Patrick Casey (writer)) and [Miller](Josh)(Josh Miller (filmmaker)), it stars [Schwartz](Ben)(Ben Schwartz) as the voice of [the Hedgehog](Sonic)(Sonic the Hedgehog (character)), alongside [Marsden](James)(James Marsden), [Sumpter](Tika)(Tika Sumpter), [Rothwell](Natasha)(Natasha Rothwell), [Pally](Adam)(Adam Pally), [Majdoub](Lee)(Lee Majdoub), [McDonough](Neal)(Neal McDonough), and [Carrey](Jim)(Jim Carrey). The film follows Sonic (voiced by Schwartz), a blue [anthropomorphic](Anthropomorphism) hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds. He teams up with a town sheriff, Tom Wachowski (Marsden), to stop the mad scientist [Robotnik](Dr.)(Doctor Eggman) (Carrey).\n\nDevelopment for a *Sonic* film began in the 1990s but did not leave the planning stage until [Pictures](Sony)(Sony Pictures) acquired the rights in 2013. Fowler was brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in [turnaround](Turnaround (filmmaking)), [Pictures](Paramount)(Paramount Pictures) acquired it in 2017. Most of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in [Vancouver](Vancouver) and on [Island](Vancouver)(Vancouver Island). Following the negative reaction to the first trailer's reveal of Sonic's appearance in April of 2019, Paramount delayed the film release by three months, taking five months to redesign Sonic in the meanwhile.\n\n*Sonic the Hedgehog* premiered at the Paramount Pictures studio lot on January 25, 2020, before being theatrically released in the United States on February 14. It set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a [game film](video)(List of films based on video games) in the United States and Canada and grossed  worldwide, becoming the [highest-grossing film of 2020](sixth)(2020 in film#Highest-grossing films), and was the highest-grossing video game film adaptation of all time in North America until 2022, when it was surpassed by its sequel. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its action sequences, performances (particularly Schwartz and Carrey's), visual effects, and Sonic's redesign and charm, but criticized its screenplay and product placement.\n\n*[the Hedgehog 2](Sonic)(Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (film))* was released in 2022, while *[the Hedgehog 3](Sonic)(Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (film))* is scheduled for 2024.

The first M270s were delivered in 1983. The MLRS were subsequently adopted by several [countries](NATO)(Member states of NATO) and other countries. The MLRS first saw service with the United States in the 1991 [War](Gulf)(Gulf War). The MLRS has been upgraded to fire guided missiles, and has been used by Ukraine in the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](2022)(2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-94195f84777b4d15ab25958e9baa7a8b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"m270_multiple_launch_rocket_system:overview\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Overview\n\nThe M270 MLRS weapons system is collectively known as the M270 MLRS Self-Propelled Loader\/Launcher (SPLL). The SPLL is composed of three primary subsystems: the M269 Loader Launcher Module (LLM), which also houses the electronic Fire Control System, is mated to the M993 Carrier Vehicle.\n\n[[Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle ATTP.jpg|thumb|Task Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle (ATTP)](File:Task)]\n\nThe M993 is the designation of the M987 carrier when it is used in the MLRS. The M987\/M993 is a lengthened derivative of the [Fighting Vehicle](Bradley)(Bradley Fighting Vehicle) chassis. The ground contact length is increased from  to . Originally called the Fighting Vehicle System, the M987 chassis was designed to serve as the basis for many other vehicles. These included the XM1070 Electronic Fighting Vehicle, the M4 Command and Control Vehicle, the Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle and the Forward Area Armored Logistics System (encompassing three vehicles including the XM1007 AFARV rearm vehicle.\n\nThe original GSRS plan called for 210&nbsp;mm diameter rockets. After European allies became involved with the project, these were replaced with 227&nbsp;mm rockets in order to accommodate the [mine](AT2)(AT2 mine).\n\n[War](Cold)(Cold War) doctrine for the M270 was for the vehicles to spread out individually and hide until needed, then move to a firing position and launch their rockets, immediately move away to a reloading point, then move to a completely new hiding position near a different firing point. These [shoot-and-scoot](shoot-and-scoot) tactics were planned to avoid susceptibility to Soviet [fire](counterbattery)(counterbattery fire). One M270 firing 12 [M26](M26 artillery rocket) rockets would drop 7,728 bomblets, and one MLRS battery of nine launchers firing 108 rockets had the equivalent firepower of 33 battalions of cannon artillery.\n\nThe system can fire rockets or [ATACMS](MGM-140)(MGM-140 ATACMS) missiles, which are contained in interchangeable pods. Each pod contains six standard rockets or one guided ATACMS missile; the two types cannot be mixed. The LLM can hold two pods at a time, which are hand-loaded using an integrated winch system. All twelve rockets or two ATACMS missiles can be fired in under a minute. One launcher firing twelve rockets can completely blanket one square [kilometer](kilometer) with [submunitions](cluster bomb). A typical MLRS cluster salvo consisted of three M270 vehicles each firing all 12 rockets. With each rocket containing 644 [grenades](M77)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition), the entire salvo would drop 23,184 grenades in the target area. However, with a two percent dud rate, that would leave approximately 400 undetonated bombs scattered over the area, which could endanger friendly troops and civilians.[After Cluster Bombs: Raining Nails](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2008\/05\/after-cluster-b\/) , *Wired*, 30 May 2008\n\nProduction of the M270 ended in 2003, when a last batch was delivered to the [Army](Egyptian)(Egyptian Army). In 2003, the U.S. Army began low-rate production of the [HIMARS](M142)(M142 HIMARS). The HIMARS fires all of the munitions of the MLRS, but is based on the chassis of the [of Medium Tactical Vehicles](Family)(Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles). As of 2012, BAE Systems still had the capability to restart production of the MLRS.\n\nIn 2006, MLRS was upgraded to fire guided rounds. Phase I testing of a guided unitary round (XM31) was completed on an accelerated schedule in March 2006. Due to an Urgent Need Statement, the guided unitary round was quickly fielded and used in action in [Iraq](Iraq War).[\"Guided MLRS Unitary Rocket Successfully Tested\"](http:\/\/www.mwjournal.com\/journal\/article.asp?HH_ID=AR_609) , *Microwave Journal*, Vol. 49, No. 3 (March 2006), p. 39. [Martin](Lockheed)(Lockheed Martin) also received a contract to convert existing M30 [Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM)](Dual-Purpose)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition) GMLRS rockets to the XM31 unitary variant.\n\nThe M31 GMLRS Unitary rocket transformed the M270 into a point target artillery system for the first time. Due to [Positioning System](Global)(Global Positioning System) (GPS) guidance and a single  high-explosive warhead, the M31 could hit targets accurately with less chance of collateral damage while needing fewer rockets to be fired, reducing logistical requirements. The unitary warhead also made the MLRS able to be used in urban environments. The M31 had a dual-mode fuse with point detonation and delay options to defeat soft targets and lightly fortified bunkers respectively, with the upgraded M31A1 equipped with a multi-mode fuse adding a [proximity](proximity fuze) [airburst](air burst) mode for use against personnel in the open; proximity mode can be set for  Height Of Burst (HOB). The GMLRS has a minimum engagement range of  and can hit a target out to , impacting at a speed of Mach 2.5.[M31 GMLRS Unitary](http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/systems\/munitions\/m31.htm) , Global security.[Precision Fires Rocket & Missile Systems](http:\/\/www.msl.army.mil\/Pages\/PFRMS\/pgmr.html) , MSL Army. In 2009 Lockheed Martin announced that a GMLRS had been successfully test fired out to .\n\nA German developmental artillery system, called the [Gun Module](Artillery)(Artillery Gun Module), has used the MLRS chassis on its developmental vehicles.\n\nIn 2012, a contract was issued to improve the armor of the M270s and improve the fire control to the standards of the M142 HIMARS. In June 2015, the M270A1 conducted tests of firing rockets after upgrades from the Improved Armored Cab project, which provides the vehicle with an enhanced armored cab and windows.[Improved Multiple Launch Rocket System tested at White Sands Missile Range](http:\/\/www.army.mil\/article\/153172\/Improved_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System_tested_at_White_Sands_Missile_Range\/) , Army, 31 July 2015\n\nIn early March 2021, Lockheed announced they had successfully fired an extended-range version of the GMLRS out to , part of an effort to increase the rocket's range to .

McMahon wanted to be a wrestler, but his father did not allow him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.\n\nIn 1968, McMahon graduated from [Carolina University](East)(East Carolina University) with a business degree and after a nondescript career as a traveling salesman, he was eager to assume a managerial role in his father's [Wide Wrestling Federation](World)(WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation) promotion. In 1969, McMahon made his debut as a ring announcer for the WWWF's *[Wrestling](All-Star)(List of former WWE programming#All-Star Wrestling (1971\u20131986))*. In 1971, he was assigned to a small territory in Maine, where he promoted his first card. He later became the play-by-play commentator for television matches after replacing [Morgan](Ray)(Ray Morgan (announcer)) in 1971, a role he regularly maintained until November 1997.\n\nIn the 1970s, McMahon became a prominent force in his father's company and, over the next decade, assisted his father in tripling TV syndication. The younger McMahon was also behind the [Ali](Muhammad)(Muhammad Ali) versus [Inoki](Antonio)(Antonio Inoki) match of 1976. He pushed for the renaming of the company to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979.\n\nOn February 21, 1980, McMahon officially founded Titan Sports and the company's headquarters were established in [Yarmouth, Massachusetts](South)(South Yarmouth, Massachusetts), using the now-defunct [Cod Coliseum](Cape)(Cape Cod Coliseum) as a home base for the company.

Asia). Since 1945, it has been divided at or near the [parallel](38th)(38th parallel north), with [Korea](North)(North Korea) (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) comprising its northern half and [Korea](South)(South Korea) (Republic of Korea) comprising its southern half. Korea consists of the **Korean Peninsula**, [Island](Jeju)(Jeju Island), and several minor islands near the peninsula. The peninsula is bordered by [China](China) ([Manchuria](Manchuria)) to the north and [Russia](Russia) to the northeast, across the [Amrok](Yalu River) and [Duman](Tumen River) rivers. It is separated from [Japan](Japan) to the southeast by the [Strait](Korea)(Korea Strait).\n\nDuring the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between three states, [Goguryeo](Goguryeo), [Baekje](Baekje), and [Silla](Silla), together known as the [Kingdoms of Korea](Three)(Three Kingdoms of Korea). In the second half of the 1st millennium, Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo, leading to the \"[Silla](Unified)(Unified Silla)\" period. Meanwhile, [Balhae](Balhae) formed in the north, superseding former Goguryeo. Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to [war](civil)(civil war), ushering in the [Three Kingdoms](Later)(Later Three Kingdoms). Toward the end of the 1st millennium, [Goguryeo](Goguryeo) was resurrected as [Goryeo](Goryeo), which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. Goryeo (also spelled as *Kory\u014f*), whose name developed into the modern [exonym](exonym) \"Korea\", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal [type](movable)(movable type) in 1234. Chronology  Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History  The Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http:\/\/www.metmuseum.org\/toah\/ht\/07\/eak.html|website=The Met's Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=19 August 2016}} However, multiple incursions by the [Empire](Mongol)(Mongol Empire) during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a [state](vassal)(Korea under Yuan rule) after decades of fighting. Following military resistance under [Gongmin](King)(King Gongmin) that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General [Seong-gye](Yi)(Yi Seong-gye), who established [Joseon](Joseon) on 17 July 1392. The first 200 years of the Joseon era were marked by relative peace, and during this time the [alphabet](Korean)(Hangul) was created by [the Great](Sejong)(Sejong the Great) and [Confucianism](Confucianism) became increasingly influential in the kingdom.\n\nJoseon's two centuries of peace were broken by foreign invasions and internal factional strife from 1592 to 1637. Most notable of these invasions is the [invasions of Korea](Japanese)(Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)), which marked the end of the Joseon dynasty's early period. Several decades later, Joseon was invaded by the [Jurchens](Later Jin (1616\u20131636)) and the [Manchus](Qing dynasty) in [1627](Later Jin invasion of Joseon) and [1636](Qing invasion of Joseon) respectively, leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy, for which the country became known as the \"[kingdom](hermit)(hermit kingdom)\" in [literature](Western)(Western literature). After the end of these invasions from [Manchuria](Manchuria), Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace and prosperity, along with cultural and technological development. What power the kingdom recovered during its isolation waned as the 18th century came to a close. Faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure, and rebellions at home, the kingdom declined rapidly in the late 19th century.\n\nDuring the later years of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the \"[kingdom](hermit)(hermit kingdom)\". By the mid 19th century, with the country [to modernize, and under encroachment of European powers](unwilling)(hermit kingdom), Joseon Korea was forced to sign [treaties](unequal)(Unequal treaty) with foreign powers. After the assassination of [Myeongseong](Empress)(Empress Myeongseong) in 1895, the [Peasant Revolution](Donghak)(Donghak Peasant Revolution), and the [Reforms of 1894 to 1896](Gabo)(Gabo Reform), the [Empire](Korean)(Korean Empire) (1897\u20131910) came into existence, heralding a brief but rapid period of social reform and modernization. However, in 1905, the Korean Empire signed a [treaty](protectorate)(Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1905) and in 1910, [annexed the Korean Empire](Japan)(Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910).\n\nJapan relinquished control over Korea after [surrendering](formally)(Surrender of Japan) to the [Allies](Allies of World War II) on 2 September 1945, in the aftermath of [War II](World)(World War II). The [Union](Soviet)(Soviet Union) and the [States](United)(United States) had agreed to partition Korea along the 38th parallel, with the [occupying the north](Soviets)(Soviet Civil Administration) and the [occupying the south](Americans)(United States Army Military Government in Korea). These circumstances became the basis for the [of Korea](division)(division of Korea) by the two [superpower](superpower)s with two different [ideologies](ideology), exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence. The communist government in the north received backing from the Soviet Union in opposition to the pro-Western government in the south, leading to Korea's division into two [state](sovereign)(sovereign state)s in 1948: North Korea and South Korea. Tensions between the two resulted in North Korea invading South Korea and the outbreak of the [War](Korean)(Korean War) in 1950. With involvement by foreign troops, the war ended in a stalemate in 1953, but without a formalised [treaty](peace)(peace treaty). This status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula, and both states continue to claim to be the sole legitimate government of Korea. A breakthrough in the peace process came on 27 April 2018, when North Korea and South Korea signed the [Declaration](Panmunjom)(Panmunjom Declaration), pledging to work toward ending the [conflict](Korean)(Korean conflict) and reaffirming the goal of reunifying the two countries.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-ea53233f3d1e4e73a22c8db17800107b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"page_id\\\": \\\"ros\\u00e9__singer\\\"}\", \"name\": \"view_sections\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"[{'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:ros\u00e9_(singer)', 'section_name': 'Ros\u00e9 (singer)'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:life_and_career', 'section_name': 'Life and career'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:1997\u20132012:_early_life', 'section_name': '1997\u20132012: Early life'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:2012\u20132015:_pre-debut', 'section_name': '2012\u20132015: Pre-debut'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:2016\u2013present:_debut_with_blackpink_and_*r*', 'section_name': '2016\u2013present: Debut with Blackpink and *R*'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:artistry', 'section_name': 'Artistry'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:influences_and_voice', 'section_name': 'Influences and voice'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:other_ventures', 'section_name': 'Other ventures'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:fashion_and_endorsements', 'section_name': 'Fashion and endorsements'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:philanthropy', 'section_name': 'Philanthropy'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:impact_and_influence', 'section_name': 'Impact and influence'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:discography', 'section_name': 'Discography'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:single_albums', 'section_name': 'Single albums'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:singles', 'section_name': 'Singles'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:other_charted_songs', 'section_name': 'Other charted songs'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:composition_credits', 'section_name': 'Composition credits'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:videography', 'section_name': 'Videography'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:music_videos', 'section_name': 'Music videos'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:filmography', 'section_name': 'Filmography'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:television_shows', 'section_name': 'Television shows'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:awards_and_nominations', 'section_name': 'Awards and nominations'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:listicles', 'section_name': 'Listicles'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:world_records', 'section_name': 'World records'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:notes', 'section_name': 'Notes'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:references', 'section_name': 'References'}, {'section_id': 'ros\u00e9__singer:external_links', 'section_name': 'External links'}]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-30c3f3a662744d91b09cf993ca423397\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"ros\\u00e9__singer:ros\\u00e9_(singer)\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Ros\u00e9 (singer)\n\n*Revision ID: 1159844439 | Timestamp: 2023-06-12T22:06:06Z*\n\n---\n\nPark Chan-young}}\n\n| birth_place       = [Auckland](Auckland), New Zealand\n\n| citizenship       =\n\n| occupation        =\n\n| years_active      =\n\n| signature         = Signature of Ros\u00e9.svg\n\n| module            = }}\n\n| current_member_of =\n\n| website           =\n\n}}\n\n| module2           =\n\n| hanja             =\n\n| rr                = Bak Chae-yeong\n\n| mr                = Pak Ch'aey\u014fng\n\n| hangulborn      =\n\n| hanjaborn       =\n\n| rrborn          = Rojen Bak\n\n| mrborn          = Rochen Pak\n\n| hangulstage       =\n\n| rrstage           = Roje\n\n| mrstage           = Roje\n\n}}\n\n}}\n\n**Roseanne Park** (born 11 February 1997), known mononymously as **Ros\u00e9** (), is a Korean-New Zealand singer and dancer based in South Korea.

At the end of 1957, American Express CEO [Reed](Ralph)(Ralph Reed (American Express)) decided to get into the card business, and by the launch date of October 1, 1958, public interest had become so significant that 250,000 cards were issued prior to the official launch date. The card was launched with an annual fee of $6, $1 higher than Diners Club, to be seen as a premium product. The first cards were made of paper, with the account number and card member's name typed. In 1959, American Express began issuing embossed plastic cards, an industry first., the company had 133.3 million cards in force, including 56.4million cards in force in the United States, each with average annual spending of $23,496. These include consumer, small business and corporate cards issued by American Express themselves and cards issued by its Global Service Network partners that run on its network (such as Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, and NAB in Australia and Lloyds Bank and Barclays Bank in the UK). On March 1, 2017, Australia's fourth-largest bank ANZ announced that it was no longer issuing American Express cards, with the support phased out entirely by August 5, 2017. American Express is the fourth largest general-purpose card network on a global basis based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and MasterCard. It is the 4th largest card network in the world, based on the number of cards it has in circulation. American Express is one of the partner banks to both [Google](Google) and [Apple](Apple Inc.)'s mobile wallet systems ([Pay](Google)(Google Wallet) and [Pay](Apple)(Apple Pay), respectively) meaning that cardholders can use their American Express-issued cards to pay at establishments where [NFC](Near field communication) payments are accepted.

The Gold Card was converted to a credit card for U.K. residents in 2018, but remains a charge card in the U.S. In 1958, American Express issued its first [card](charge)(charge card), which required payment at the end of every month. In 1966, the company issued its first gold card, in an effort to cater to the upper echelon of business travel. Its platinum card debuted in 1984. In 1999, American Express introduced the [Card](Centurion)(Centurion Card), often referred to as the \"black card,\" which caters to an even more affluent customer segment. The card was initially available only to select users of the Platinum card. The annual fee for the card in the United States is $5,000 (up from $1,000 at introduction) with an additional one-time initiation fee of $10,000. American Express created the card line amid rumors and [legend](urban)(urban legend)s in the 1980s that it produced an ultra-exclusive black card for elite users who could purchase anything with it. American Express cards publicly issued in the United States range in cost between no annual fee (for Blue and many other consumer and business cards) and a $695 annual fee (for the Platinum card). Annual fees for the Green card start at $150, while Gold card annual fees start at $250.\n\nAs of January 2023, the company produces the following core suite of cards for consumers, some of which have corresponding business variants, along with their respective fees:\n\nAmerican Express has several co-branded credit cards, with most falling into one of three categories:\n\n* Airlines: [Argentinas](Aerol\u00edneas)(Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas), [Aerom\u00e9xico](Aerom\u00e9xico), [Canada](Air)(Air Canada), [France](Air)(Air France), [Alitalia](Alitalia), [Airways](British)(British Airways), [Pacific](Cathay)(Cathay Pacific), [Air Lines](Delta)(Delta Air Lines), [Icelandair](Icelandair), [KLM](KLM), [Qantas](Qantas), [Airlines](Scandinavian)(Scandinavian Airlines), [Airlines](Singapore)(Singapore Airlines), [Airlines](SriLankan)(SriLankan Airlines), [Airways](Thai)(Thai Airways), [Australia](Virgin)(Virgin Australia), among others.\n\n* Hotels: [Western](Best)(Best Western), [Hotels](Hilton)(Hilton Hotels), [International](Marriott)(Marriott International), and [Peninsula Hotels](The)(The Peninsula Hotels)\n\n* Retailers: [Jones](David)(David Jones Limited), [Renfrew](Holt)(Holt Renfrew), [Harrods](Harrods), [Macy's](Macy's), [Bloomingdales](Bloomingdales), [Lowe's](Lowe's), [Mercedes-Benz](Mercedes-Benz), [Dillard's](Dillard's) and others.\n\nA credit card aimed at young adults is called *Blue*, which has no annual fee and a [program](loyalty)(loyalty program). A television media campaign for Blue adopted the 1979 UK [Synthpop](Synthpop) hit \"[Cars](Cars (song))\" by [Numan](Gary)(Gary Numan) as its [music](theme)(theme music). A [reward program](cashback)(cashback reward program) version, \"Blue Cash\", quickly followed. American Express also targeted young adults with City Reward Cards that earn INSIDE Rewards points to eat, drink, and play in New York, Chicago, and LA hot spots. American Express began phasing out the INSIDE cards in mid-2008, with no new applications being taken as of July 2008.\n\nIn 2002, American Express introduced Clear, advertised as the first credit card with no fees of any kind. Other cards introduced in 2005, included \"The Knot\" and \"The Nest\" Credit Cards from American Express, co-branded cards developed with the wedding planning website theknot.com. In 2006, the UK division of American Express joined the [Red](Product)(Product Red) coalition and issued a Red Card, donating with each purchase through [Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria](The)(The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) to help African women and children with HIV\/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. In 2009, American Express introduced the ZYNC charge card. White in color, this card was created for people aged 20\u201340. The Zync charge card has since been discontinued with the exception of current cardholders who are [grandfathered](grandfathered) into the ZYNC. In late 2012, American Express and [Walmart](Walmart) announced the launch of Bluebird, a [debit card](prepaid)(prepaid debit card) similar to that of [Dot](Green)(Green Dot Corporation). Bluebird is being touted as having some of the benefits of traditional American Express cards, such as [assistance](roadside)(roadside assistance) and [theft](identity)(identity theft) protection. The card can also be used as a substitute for a traditional [account](checking)(Transactional account). Unlike other such cards, Bluebird is [FDIC](Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation)-insured.

For example, \"Cassilda's Song\" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:\"The King in Yellow\" in e.g.\n\nThe short story \"The Mask\" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:\"The Mask\" in e.g.\n\nIt is also stated, in \"The Repairer of Reputations\", that the final moment of the first act involves the character Camilla's \"agonized scream and [...] awful words echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa\".\n\nAll of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the \"irresistible\" revealed truths: \"The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect\". Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: \"If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it\" (\"[Repairer of Reputations](The)(The Repairer of Reputations)\").\n\nChambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from \"The Repairer of Reputations\":\n\nHe mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. \"The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever\", he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.\n\nA similar passage occurs in \"The Yellow Sign\", in which two protagonists have read *The King in Yellow*:\n\nNight fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The fictional play within *The King in Yellow* that induces despair or madness is titled **\"The King in Yellow\"**.

Unlike [liner](ocean)(ocean liner)s, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports-of-call, where passengers may go on [tours](Tourism) known as \"shore excursions\". They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by the [tonnage](gross)(gross tonnage)(GT), bigger than many [ships](cargo)(List of largest container ships). Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s; before then, few were more than 50,000GT. In the decades since, the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled. There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000GT or greater. In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). , the largest cruise ship, , has a gross tonnage of 236,857, is  long,  wide, and holds up to 6,988 passengers.\n\nCruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship's crew. Modern cruise ships, while sacrificing some qualities of [seaworthiness](seakeeping), have added amenities to cater to [tourists](nautical)(nautical tourism), with recent vessels being described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\". The \"megaships\" went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas, and feature ameneties such as theaters, fine-dining and chain restaurants, spas, fitness centers, casinos, sports facilities, and even amusement park attractions.\n\nCruise ships require electricity for powering both hotel services and for [propulsion](Marine propulsion). Cruise ships are designed with all the heavy machinery at the bottom of the ship and lightweight materials at the top, making them inherently stable even as ship designs are getting taller and taller, and most passenger ships utilize [fins](stabilizer)(Stabilizer (ship)) to further reduce rolling of tall ships in heavy weather. While some cruise ships use traditional fixed [propeller](propeller)s and [rudder](rudder)s to steer, most larger ships use propellers that can swivel left and right to steer the ship, known as [thruster](azimuth)(azimuth thruster)s, which allow even the largest ship designs to have adequate maneuverability.\n\nCruise ships are operated by [line](cruise)(cruise line)s, which are [companies](company) that market cruises to the public. In the 1990s, many cruise lines were bought by much larger holding companies and continue to operate as brands or subsidiaries of the holding company. For instance, [Corporation & plc](Carnival)(Carnival Corporation & plc) owns both the [mass-market](Mass market) [Cruise Line](Carnival)(Carnival Cruise Line), focused on larger party ships for younger travelers, and [America Line](Holland)(Holland America Line), whose smaller ships cultivate an image of classic elegance. The common practice in the cruise industry in ship sales and orders is to list the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, as the recipient cruise line of the ship.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"As of 2023, the largest cruise ship, *Wonder of the Seas*, has a gross tonnage of 236,857.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":6080.826997757,"scoring_ms":609.7364425659,"total_ms":6691.8804645538,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"236,857 GT","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

I did not concern myself with music at all.\"Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 55. He wrote that contact with Balakirev in September 1865 encouraged him \"to get accustomed to music and later to plunge into it\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 56. At Balakirev's suggestion, he wrote a trio to the [scherzo](scherzo) of the E-flat minor symphony, which it had lacked up to that point, and reorchestrated the entire symphony.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, pp. 58\u201359. Its first performance came in December of that year under Balakirev's direction in Saint Petersburg.Abraham, *New Grove (1980)*, 16:28. A second performance followed in March 1866 under the direction of Konstantin Lyadov (father of composer [Lyadov](Anatoly)(Anatoly Lyadov)).\n\nCorrespondence between Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev clearly shows that some ideas for the symphony originated with Balakirev, who seldom stopped at merely correcting a piece of music, and would often recompose it at the piano. Rimsky-Korsakov recalled,\n\nA pupil like myself had to submit to Balakirev a proposed composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try hard to make the author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended over a long period of time under the cold control of self-criticism.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 29.\n\n[[File:Balakirev from 1914 Windsor Magazine.png|thumb|upright|alt=A man in his late 20s or early 30s with dark hair and a bushy beard, wearing a dark coat, dress shirt and tie|[Balakirev](Mily)(Mily Balakirev) encouraged Rimsky-Korsakov to continue composing.]]\n\nRimsky-Korsakov recalled that \"Balakirev had no difficulty in getting along with me. At his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed by me and brought them to completion with the help of his advice and improvisations\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 30. Though Rimsky-Korsakov later found Balakirev's influence stifling, and broke free from it,Maes, p. 44. this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer's talents as a critic and improviser. Under Balakirev's mentoring, Rimsky-Korsakov turned to other compositions. He began a symphony in B minor, but felt it too closely followed [Beethoven](Ludwig van Beethoven)'s [Symphony](Ninth)(Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)) and abandoned it. He completed an Overture on Three Russian Themes, based on Balakirev's folksong overtures, as well as a [on Serbian Themes](Fantasia)(Fantasy on Serbian Themes) that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the [Congress](Slavonic)(Pan-Slavism) in 1867. In his review of this concert, nationalist critic [Stasov](Vladimir)(Vladimir Stasov) coined the phrase *Moguchaya kuchka* for the Balakirev circle (*Moguchaya kuchka* is usually translated as \"The Mighty Handful\" or \"The Five\"). Rimsky-Korsakov also composed the initial versions of *Sadko* and *[Antar](Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov))*, which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov socialized and discussed music with the other members of The Five; they critiqued one another's works in progress and collaborated on new pieces. He became friends with [Borodin](Alexander)(Alexander Borodin), whose music \"astonished\" him.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 57. He spent an increasing amount of time with Mussorgsky. Balakirev and Mussorgsky played piano four-hand music, Mussorgsky would sing, and they frequently discussed other composers' works, with preferred tastes running \"toward Glinka, Schumann and Beethoven's late quartets\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 21. [Mendelssohn](Felix Mendelssohn) was not thought of highly, [Mozart](Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) and [Haydn](Joseph Haydn) \"were considered out of date and na\u00efve\", and [Bach](J.S.)(Johann Sebastian Bach) merely mathematical and unfeeling. Berlioz \"was highly esteemed\", Liszt \"crippled and perverted from a musical point of view&nbsp;... even a caricature\", and Wagner discussed little. Rimsky-Korsakov \"listened to these opinions with avidity and absorbed the tastes of Balakirev, Cui and Mussorgsky without reasoning or examination\". Often, the musical works in question \"were played before me only in fragments, and I had no idea of the whole work\". This, he wrote, did not stop him from accepting these judgments at face value and repeating them \"as if I were thoroughly convinced of their truth\".\n\nRimsky-Korsakov became especially appreciated within The Five, and among those who visited the circle, for his talents as an orchestrator. He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a [Schubert](Franz Schubert) march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera *[Ratcliff](William)(William Ratcliff (Cui))* and by [Dargomyzhsky](Alexander)(Alexander Dargomyzhsky), whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five and who was close to death, to orchestrate his opera *[Stone Guest](The)(The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky))*.\n\nIn late 1871, Rimsky-Korsakov moved into Voin's former apartment, and invited Mussorgsky to be his roommate. The working arrangement they agreed upon was that Mussorgsky used the piano in the mornings while Rimsky-Korsakov worked on copying or orchestration. When Mussorgsky left for his civil service job at noon, Rimsky-Korsakov then used the piano. Time in the evenings was allotted by mutual agreement. \"That autumn and winter the two of us accomplished a good deal\", Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, \"with constant exchange of ideas and plans. Mussorgsky composed and orchestrated the Polish act of *[Godunov](Boris)(Boris Godunov (opera))* and the folk scene 'Near Kromy.' I orchestrated and finished my *[of Pskov](Maid)(The Maid of Pskov)*.\"Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 123.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-51a85b049e714afe96a11447c76867e2\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"nikolai_rimsky-korsakov:compositions\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"## Compositions\n\n[[File:Walentin Alexandrowitsch Serow 004.jpg|thumb|alt=A man with dark gray hair, glasses and a long beard seated at a desk, looking at a music manuscript|Portrait of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov by [Serov](Valentin)(Valentin Serov) (1898)]]\n\nRimsky-Korsakov followed the musical ideals espoused by The Five. He employed Orthodox liturgical themes in the *[Easter Festival Overture](Russian)(Russian Easter Festival Overture)*, folk song in *[Espagnol](Capriccio)(Capriccio Espagnol)* and orientalism in *[Scheherazade](Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov))*, possibly his best known work.Maes, pp. 175\u2013176. He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self-critical one. He revised every orchestral work up to and including his Third Symphony\u2014some, like *[Antar](Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov))* and *[Sadko](Sadko (musical tableau))*, more than once. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale [transposition](transposition (music)) and complete recomposition.Abraham, *Slavonic*, pp. 197\u2013198.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov was open about the influences in his music, telling Vasily Yastrebtsev, \"Study Liszt and Balakirev more closely, and you'll see that a great deal in me is not mine\".Yastrebtsev, p. 37. He followed Balakirev in his use of the whole tone scale, treatment of folk songs and musical [orientalism](orientalism) and Liszt for harmonic adventurousness. (The violin melody used to portray [Scheherazade](Scheherazade) is very closely related to its counterpart in Balakirev's symphonic poem *[Tamara](Tamara (Balakirev))*, while the *Russian Easter Overtures* follows the design and plan of Balakirev's Second Overture on Russian Themes.)\n\nNevertheless, while he took Glinka and Liszt as his harmonic models, his use of [tone](whole)(whole tone scale) and [scale](octatonic)(octatonic scale)s do demonstrate his originality. He developed both these compositional devices for the \"fantastic\" sections of his operas, which depicted magical or supernatural characters and events.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov maintained an interest in harmonic experiments and continued exploring new idioms throughout his career. He tempered this interest with an abhorrence of excess and kept his tendency to experiment under constant control. The more radical his harmonies became, the more he attempted to control them with strict rules\u2014applying his \"musical conscience\", as he called it. In this sense, he was both a progressive and a conservative composer.Maes, p. 180. The whole tone and octatonic scales were both considered adventurous in the Western classical tradition, and Rimsky-Korsakov's use of them made his harmonies seem radical. Conversely, his care about how or when in a composition he used these scales made him seem conservative compared with later composers like [Stravinsky](Igor)(Igor Stravinsky), though they were often building on Rimsky-Korsakov's work.Maes, pp. 180, 195.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The Russian composer who was a member of the group known as The Five and is famous for the orchestral suite *Scheherazade* is Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":7380.1748752594,"scoring_ms":506.3478946686,"total_ms":7886.6610527039,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov","total_tool_calls":4.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":2.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

In 2004, it released the [Portable](PlayStation)(PlayStation Portable) (PSP) to compete with the [DS](Nintendo)(Nintendo DS) as part of the [generation of video game consoles](seventh)(seventh generation of video game consoles). After a slow start in the worldwide market, it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the *[Hunter](Monster)(Monster Hunter)* series. With the series being less popular in western regions, it failed to revive the platform in the same way. The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company. It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share, with almost 80 million units sold in its lifespan, roughly the same amount as Nintendo's [Boy Advance](Game)(Game Boy Advance) had during the [generation of video game consoles](sixth)(sixth generation of video game consoles). This is only a little more than half of the sales of its actual market competitor, the DS, which was more than 150 million units by the end of 2011.\n\nRumors of a successor to the PSP came as early as July 2009 when *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* reported that Sony was working on such a device, which would utilize the PowerVR SGX543MP processor and perform at a level similar to the original [Xbox](Xbox (console)). Through mid-2010, websites continued to run stories about accounts of the existence of a \"PSP 2\". Reports arose during the [Game Show](Tokyo)(Tokyo Game Show) that the device was unveiled internally during a private meeting during mid-September held at Sony Computer Entertainment's headquarters in Aoyama, Tokyo. Shortly after, reports of [kits](development)(development kits) for the handheld had reportedly already been shipped to numerous video game developers including both [first-party](SIE Worldwide Studios) and third-party developers to start making games for the device, a report later confirmed by *[Kombat](Mortal)(Mortal Kombat (2011 video game))* Executive Producer Shaun Himmerick. By November, Senior Vice President of [Arts](Electronic)(Electronic Arts), Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that he had seen that the PlayStation Portable successor existed, but could not confirm details. In the same month, [VG247](VG247) released pictures of an early prototype version showing a [Go](PSP)(PSP Go)-like slide-screen design along with two analog sticks, two cameras and a microphone, though the report mentioned that overheating issues had since caused them to move away from the design in favor of a model more similar to the original PlayStation Portable device.\n\nThroughout 2010, Sony would not confirm these reports of a PSP successor but would make comments regarding making future hardware. [Yoshida](Shuhei)(Shuhei Yoshida), President of [Worldwide Studios](SCE)(SCE Worldwide Studios) revealed that his studio, despite usually being more involved with software, had a continued role in future hardware development at the time. In December, [Computer Entertainment](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment) CEO [Hirai](Kazuo)(Kazuo Hirai) stated that Sony aimed to appeal to a wide demographic of people by using multiple input methods on future hardware; buttons and joysticks for traditional handheld game system users, and touchscreens for [phone](smart)(smart phone) users. The device was officially announced by Sony on January 27, 2011, at their \"PlayStation Meeting\" press conference held by the company in Japan. The system, only known by its code name \"Next Generation Portable\", was announced to be a handheld gaming device that aimed for [3](PlayStation)(PlayStation 3) quality visuals, which was later clarified to not be taken at a literal level because, according to David Coombes, platform research manager at [Computer Entertainment America](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment America), \"Well, it's not going to run at 2&nbsp;GHz [the PS3](like) because the battery would last five minutes and it would probably set fire to your pants\". Its power was later described by Sony engineers as about halfway between the PSP and PS3. As rumors had suggested, the device was designed to present \"the best of both worlds\" between mobile and handheld gaming, including a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, a rear touchpad coupled with physical buttons and dual analog sticks. Sony also revealed that the device would be using a mix of retail and digital distribution of games. Further details were announced at [Developers Conference](Game)(Game Developers Conference) 2011, including that Sony would be dropping the PSP's [UMD](Universal Media Disc) disc format in favor of small game cartridges of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB size variants.  along with two cameras, facial detection, head detection and tracking capabilities.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The codename used for the PlayStation Vita before its official announcement was \"Next Generation Portable.\"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":3075.0327110291,"scoring_ms":409.5375537872,"total_ms":3488.6515140533,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Next Generation Portable","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Its [range](native)(species distribution) lies largely within the [Circle](Arctic)(Arctic Circle), encompassing the [Ocean](Arctic)(Arctic Ocean) and its surrounding seas and landmasses, which includes the northernmost regions of [America](North)(North America) and [Eurasia](Eurasia). It is the largest [extant](extant taxon) bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore. A boar (adult male) weighs around , while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the [species](sister)(sister species) of the [bear](brown)(brown bear), it has evolved to occupy a narrower [niche](ecological)(ecological niche), with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting [seals](Pinniped), which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the [ice](sea)(sea ice). Their scientific name means \"[maritime](sea) bear\" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as [mammal](marine)(marine mammal)s.\n\nBecause of expected [loss](habitat)(habitat loss) caused by [change](climate)(climate change), the polar bear is classified as a [species](vulnerable)(vulnerable species). For decades, large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species, but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect. For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key figure in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of [peoples](circumpolar)(circumpolar peoples), and polar bears remain important in their cultures. Historically, the polar bear has also been known as the \"white bear\". It is sometimes referred to as the \"nanook\", based on the [Inuit](Inuit languages) term *nanuq*.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-19f7114be9bd45c3873e0edb780233a2\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"polar_bear:contemporary_regulations\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Contemporary regulations\n\n[[sign warning about the presence of bears. The Norwegian text translates into \"Applies to all of Svalbard\".](File:Polar-Bear-Warning-Longyearbyen.jpg|thumb|right|Road)]\n\nConcerns over the future survival of the species led to the development of national regulations on polar bear hunting, beginning in the mid-1950s. The Soviet Union banned all hunting in 1956. Canada began imposing hunting quotas in 1968. Norway passed a series of increasingly strict regulations from 1965 to 1973, and has completely banned hunting since then. The United States began regulating hunting in 1971 and adopted the [Mammal Protection Act](Marine)(Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972) in 1972. In 1973, the [Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears](International)(International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears) was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the [Union](Soviet)(Soviet Union), and the United States. Member countries agreed to place restrictions on recreational and commercial hunting, ban hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, and conduct further research.[International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20030409113042\/http:\/\/pbsg.npolar.no\/ConvAgree\/agreement.htm), 15 November 1973, Oslo The treaty allows hunting \"by local people using traditional methods\". Norway is the only country of the five in which all harvest of polar bears is banned. The agreement was a rare case of international cooperation during the [War](Cold)(Cold War). Biologist [Stirling](Ian)(Ian Stirling (biologist)) commented, \"For many years, the conservation of polar bears was the only subject in the entire Arctic that nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain could agree upon sufficiently to sign an agreement. Such was the intensity of human fascination with this magnificent predator, the only marine bear.\"[Ian](Stirling,)(Ian Stirling (biologist)) *Foreword* in\n\nAgreements have been made between countries to co-manage their shared polar bear subpopulations. After several years of negotiations, Russia and the United States signed an agreement in October 2000 to jointly set quotas for indigenous subsistence hunting in Alaska and [Chukotka](Chukotka Autonomous Okrug). The treaty was ratified in October 2007. In September 2015, the polar bear range states agreed upon a \"circumpolar action plan\" describing their conservation strategy for polar bears.\n\nThe species is listed in Appendix II of the [on International Trade in Endangered Species](Convention)(Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) (CITES) meaning international trade, including in parts or derivatives, is controlled by the CITES system of permits and certificates. The United States government has proposed that polar bears be transferred to Appendix I of [CITES](CITES) which would ban all commercial international trade in polar bear parts. The decision to leave the species listed under Appendix II was endorsed by the IUCN and [TRAFFIC](TRAFFIC), who determined that such an uplisting was unlikely to confer a conservation benefit.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The five nations that are signatories of the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears are:\n\n1.

It was founded as a joint-stock corporation by the merger of the express companies owned by [Wells](Henry)(Henry Wells) (Wells & Company), [G. Fargo](William)(William G. Fargo) (Livingston, Fargo & Company), and [Warren Butterfield](John)(John Warren Butterfield) (Wells, Butterfield & Company, the successor earlier in 1850 of Butterfield, Wasson & Company). Wells and Fargo also started [Fargo & Co.](Wells)(History of Wells Fargo) in 1852 when Butterfield and other directors objected to the proposal that American Express extend its operations to California. American Express initially established its headquarters in a building at the intersection of Jay Street and [Street](Hudson)(Hudson Street (Manhattan)) in what was later called the [Tribeca](Tribeca) section of Manhattan. For years it enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the movement of express shipments (goods, securities, currency, etc.) throughout New York State. In 1874, American Express moved its headquarters to 65 Broadway in what was becoming the [District](Financial)(Financial District, Manhattan) of Manhattan, a location it was to retain through two buildings.[[express dog 1890.jpg|thumb|181x181px|An advert from 1890 featuring a watchdog on an American Express shipping trunk |left](File:Amer)]In 1854, the American Express Co. purchased a lot on Vesey Street in New York City as the site for its stables. The company's first New York headquarters was an 1858 marble Italianate palazzo at 55\u201361 [Street](Hudson)(Hudson Street (Manhattan)), which had a busy freight depot on the ground story with a spur line from the [River Railroad](Hudson)(Hudson River Railroad). A stable was constructed in 1867, five blocks north at 4\u20138 Hubert Street. The company prospered sufficiently that headquarters were moved in 1874 from the wholesale shipping district to the budding Financial District and into rented offices in two five-story brownstone commercial buildings at 63 and 65 Broadway that were owned by the Harmony family.\n\nIn 1880, American Express built a new warehouse behind the Broadway Building at 46 Trinity Place. The designer is unknown, but it has a fa\u00e7ade of brick arches that are reminiscent of pre-skyscraper New York. American Express has long been out of this building, but it still bears a [terracotta](terracotta) seal with the American Express Eagle. In 1890\u201391 the company constructed a new ten-story building by [H. Kendall](Edward)(Edward H. Kendall) on the site of its former headquarters on [Street](Hudson)(Hudson Street (Manhattan)). By 1903, the company had assets of some $28&nbsp;million, second only to the [City Bank of New York](National)(Citibank) among [institution](financial)(financial institution)s in the city. To reflect this, the company purchased the Broadway buildings and site. At the end of the Wells-Fargo reign in 1914, an aggressive new president, George Chadbourne Taylor (1868\u20131923), who had worked his way up through the company over the previous thirty years, decided to build a new headquarters. The old buildings, dubbed by *[New York Times](The)(The New York Times)* as \"among the ancient landmarks\" of lower Broadway, were inadequate for such a rapidly expanding concern.\n\nAfter some delays due to the First World War, the 21-story [neo-classical](Neoclassicism) [Express Co. Building](American)(65 Broadway) was constructed in 1916\u201317 to the design of James L. Aspinwall, of the firm of Renwick, Aspinwall & Tucker, the successor to the architectural practice of the eminent [Renwick Jr.](James)(James Renwick Jr.) The building consolidated the two lots of the former buildings with a single address: [Broadway](65)(65 Broadway). This building was part of the \"Express Row\" section of lower Broadway at the time. The building completed the continuous masonry wall of its block-front and assisted in transforming Broadway into the \"canyon\" of neo-classical masonry office towers familiar to this day. American Express sold this building in 1975, but retained travel services there. The building was also the headquarters over the years of other prominent firms, including investment bankers [W. Seligman & Co](J.&)(J. & W. Seligman & Co.). (1940\u201374), the [Bureau of Shipping](American)(American Bureau of Shipping), a maritime concern (1977\u201386), and later J.J. Kenny, and [& Poor's](Standard)(Standard & Poor's), the latter of which renamed the building for itself.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-92630d5d64e1401ba9c941f35f32c19a\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"american_express:1980s_to_present\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### 1980s to present\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-53da39c5d97848da9357f97f50b53a97\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"american_express:national_expansion\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### National expansion\n\nAmerican Express extended its reach nationwide by arranging affiliations with other express companies (including [Fargo](Wells)(History of Wells Fargo) \u2013 the replacement for the two former companies that merged to form American Express), railroads, and steamship companies. In 1857, American Express started its expansion in the area of financial services by launching a [order](money)(money order) business to compete with the [States Post Office](United)(United States Post Office)'s money orders. Sometime between 1888 and 1890, [C. Fargo](J.)(J. C. Fargo) took a trip to Europe and returned frustrated and infuriated. Despite the fact that he was president of American Express and that he carried with him traditional [of credit](letters)(letter of credit), he found it difficult to obtain cash anywhere except in major cities. Fargo went to [Flemming Berry](Marcellus)(Marcellus Flemming Berry) and asked him to create a better solution than the letter of credit. Berry introduced the American Express [Cheque](Traveler's)(traveler's cheque) which was launched in 1891 in denominations of $10, $20, $50, and $100.\n\nTraveler's cheques established American Express as a truly international company. In 1914, at the onset of [War I](World)(World War I), American Express in Europe was among the few companies to honor the letters of credit (issued by various banks) held by Americans in Europe, because other financial institutions refused to assist these stranded travelers. The British government appointed American Express its official agent at the beginning of World War I. They were to deliver letters, money, and relief parcels to British prisoners of war. Their employees went into camps to cash drafts for both British and French prisoners and arranged for them to receive money from home. By the end of the war they were delivering 150 tonnes of parcels per day to prisoners in six countries.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-1f6f9c61db694b25bf1b503eb6644515\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"american_express:railroad_express_business\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Railroad express business\n\n[[Amerikanen bij American Express Damrak om geld en dergelijke in te wisselen, Bestanddeelnr 924-8211.jpg|thumb|An American Express branch in 1974](File:Veel)]\n\nAmerican Express was one of the monopolies that [Theodore Roosevelt](President)(Theodore Roosevelt) had the [Commerce Commission](Interstate)(Interstate Commerce Commission) (ICC) investigate during his administration. The interest of the ICC was drawn to its strict control of the railroad express business. However, the solution did not come immediately to hand. The solution to this problem came as a coincidence to other problems during World War I. During the winter of 1917, the United States suffered a severe coal shortage and on December 26 [President](President of the United States) [Wilson](Woodrow)(Woodrow Wilson) commandeered the railroads on behalf of the United States government to move [troops](federal)(United States Armed Forces), their supplies, and coal. Treasury Secretary [Gibbs McAdoo](William)(William Gibbs McAdoo) was assigned the task of consolidating the railway lines for the [effort](war)(war effort). All contracts between express companies and railroads were nullified and McAdoo proposed that all existing express companies be consolidated into a single company to serve the country's needs. This ended American Express's express business and removed them from the ICC's interest. The result was that a new company called the [Railway Express Agency](American)(Railway Express Agency) formed in July 1918. The new entity took custody of all the pooled equipment and property of existing express companies (the largest share of which, 40%, came from American Express, who had owned the rights to the express business over  of railroad lines, and had 10,000 offices, with over 30,000 employees). In 1966, American Express introduced the Gold Card. American Express formed a venture with [Communications](Warner)(Warner Communications) in 1979, called [Satellite Entertainment](Warner-Amex)(Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment), which created MTV, [Nickelodeon](Nickelodeon), and [Movie Channel](The)(The Movie Channel). The partnership lasted only until 1984.

roots\n\n[[File:John Broadus Watson.JPG|thumb|[B. Watson](John)(John B. Watson)]]\n\nGroundbreaking work of behaviorism began with [B. Watson](John)(John B. Watson) and [Rayner](Rosalie)(Rosalie Rayner)'s studies of conditioning in 1920. Behaviorally-centered therapeutic approaches appeared as early as 1924 with [Cover Jones](Mary)(Mary Cover Jones)' work dedicated to the unlearning of fears in children. These were the antecedents of the development of [Wolpe](Joseph)(Joseph Wolpe)'s behavioral therapy in the 1950s. It was the work of Wolpe and Watson, which was based on [Pavlov](Ivan)(Ivan Pavlov)'s work on learning and conditioning, that influenced [Eysenck](Hans)(Hans Eysenck) and [Lazarus](Arnold)(Arnold Lazarus) to develop new behavioral therapy techniques based on [conditioning](classical)(classical conditioning).\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, behavioral therapy became widely used by researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. Their inspiration was by the [behaviorist](Behaviorism) learning theory of [Pavlov](Ivan)(Ivan Pavlov), [B. Watson](John)(John B. Watson), and [L. Hull](Clark)(Clark L. Hull).\n\nIn Britain, [Wolpe](Joseph)(Joseph Wolpe), who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of [desensitization](systematic)(systematic desensitization), applied behavioral research to the treatment of neurotic disorders. Wolpe's therapeutic efforts were precursors to today's fear reduction techniques. British psychologist [Eysenck](Hans)(Hans Eysenck) presented behavior therapy as a constructive alternative.\n\nAt the same time as Eysenck's work, [F. Skinner](B.)(B. F. Skinner) and his associates were beginning to have an impact with their work on [conditioning](operant)(operant conditioning). Skinner's work was referred to as [behaviorism](radical)(radical behaviorism) and avoided anything related to cognition. However, [Rotter](Julian)(Julian Rotter) in 1954 and [Bandura](Albert)(Albert Bandura) in 1969 contributed behavior therapy with their respective work on [learning theory](social)(social learning theory) by demonstrating the effects of cognition on learning and behavior modification. The work of the Australian [Weekes](Claire)(Claire Weekes) dealing with anxiety disorders in the 1960s is also seen as a prototype of behavior therapy.\n\nThe emphasis on behavioral factors constituted the \"first wave\" of CBT.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"John B.

Robinson](Charles)(Charles M. Robinson (video director)) in October 2009]]\n\nHart came to prominence from his guest appearance in *[Undeclared](Undeclared)*. He made his film debut in the film *[Soldiers](Paper)(Paper Soldiers)*. Hart then gained further recognition from his other films such as the *[Movie](Scary)(Scary Movie (film series))* franchise, *[Plane](Soul)(Soul Plane)*, *[40-Year-Old Virgin](The)(The 40-Year-Old Virgin)*, *[at a Funeral](Death)(Death at a Funeral (2010 film))* and *[Fockers](Little)(Little Fockers)*. He turned down a role in the 2008 film *[Thunder](Tropic)(Tropic Thunder)* because the character is gay, citing his own \"insecurities\".\n\nHe played Doug in the film *[Five-Year Engagement](The)(The Five-Year Engagement)* (2012) and appeared in *[Like a Man](Think)(Think Like a Man)* which was a box office success. He also appeared in the [sequel](Think Like a Man Too). He had a cameo as himself in *[Is the End](This)(This Is the End)*. In 2013, Hart played a boxing promoter in *[Match](Grudge)(Grudge Match)* and appeared in *[Strategy](Exit)(Exit Strategy (film))* as Mannequin Head Man. He also appeared in *[and Ticking](35)(35 and Ticking)*.\n\nIn 2014, Hart starred as Ben in *[Along](Ride)(Ride Along (film))*, opposite [Cube](Ice)(Ice Cube). The film received generally negative reviews from critics, but was a major box office success. Hart returned in the sequel, *[Along 2](Ride)(Ride Along 2)*, which was released on January 15, 2016.\n\nIn 2013, Hart co-created *[Husbands of Hollywood](Real)(Real Husbands of Hollywood)* with [Spencer](Chris)(Chris Spencer (actor)). The show follows Hart along with other married celebrities (each playing a comical fictionalized version of themselves) within the series including: [Kodjoe](Boris)(Boris Kodjoe), [Nelly](Nelly), [Martin](Duane)(Duane Martin), [Smoove](J.B.)(J.B. Smoove), [Cannon](Nick)(Nick Cannon) and [Thicke](Robin)(Robin Thicke). Thicke did not return for the second season due to his music career, though Hart has stated that the door is open for Thicke to return. (Archive link requires scrolldown.) The series is intentionally filmed in a style similar to [Bravo](Bravo (U.S. TV channel))'s *[Real Housewives](The)(The Real Housewives)*. Episodes often hinge on the \"real\" Hart's desperately unsuccessful attempts to climb Hollywood's celebrity social ladder (which always backfire in humiliating ways), and the character's barely-hidden jealousy of his more successful celebrity friends. A sneak peek was shown as a segment during the [BET Awards](2012)(2012 BET Awards) and the official promo was released in October 2012.\n\nIn 2015, Hart starred in the films *[Hard](Get)(Get Hard)* with [Ferrell](Will)(Will Ferrell) and *[Wedding Ringer](The)(The Wedding Ringer)*. In 2016, he starred in the movies *[Intelligence](Central)(Central Intelligence)*, with [Johnson](Dwayne)(Dwayne Johnson) and the animated *[Secret Life of Pets](The)(The Secret Life of Pets)*. In 2017, he starred in the movies *[Underpants: The First Epic Movie](Captain)(Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie)*, in a voice role, and *[Welcome to the Jungle](Jumanji:)(Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle)* with [Black](Jack)(Jack Black), [Gillan](Karen)(Karen Gillan), and reteaming again with Johnson. He earned an estimated $32.5 million in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, he produced his first film under his production company HartBeat Productions, *[School](Night)(Night School (2018 film))*. In October 2018, it was announced that through his production company, he has signed a first-look deal with [Nickelodeon](Nickelodeon). Under the deal, Hart and his HartBeat Productions banner will develop and produce live-action, scripted kids content for the network. Hart also has a first-look film deal with [Studios](Universal)(Universal Studios).\n\nIn 2019, Hart's film *[Upside](The)(The Upside)*, his first headlining role in a drama, was theatrically released. It also starred [Cranston](Bryan)(Bryan Cranston) and [Kidman](Nicole)(Nicole Kidman). Hart also reprised his role of Snowball in the sequel *[Secret Life of Pets 2](The)(The Secret Life of Pets 2)*.\n\nIn 2021, Hart starred in *[Fatherhood](Fatherhood (film))*, a [drama](Drama (modern genre)) about a man whose wife dies shortly after childbirth, leaving him to raise their daughter on his own. It premiered on Netflix on June 18, 2021.\n\nIn 2020, his series *[Hart](Die)(Die Hart)* premiered on [Quibi](Quibi) on July 20 and had a strong first weekend, with numerous households reportedly streaming the series. On June 9, [ROKU](Roku) and Hart's multi-platform comedy brand [Out Loud](Laugh)(Laugh Out Loud Productions) debuted the series' second season on [Roku Channel](The)(The Roku Channel). In addition to returning to his starring role, Hart executive produced the second season; Laugh Out Loud CEO and Hart's longtime business partner, Jeff Clanagan, serve as a producer on the project.\n\nHart later played Arnold Drummond in the ''[Strokes](Diff'rent)(Diff'rent Strokes)* portion of the third edition of *[in Front of a Studio Audience](Live)(Live in Front of a Studio Audience)''.\n\nIn 2022, Hart starred alongside [Wahlberg](Mark)(Mark Wahlberg) in the comedy film, *[Time](Me)(Me Time (film))*. The movie shows how Sonny (Hart) experiences a wild journey with his friend after finding a much-longed free weekend.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The 2021 drama film starring Kevin Hart that premiered on Netflix about a man raising his daughter alone after his wife's death is *Fatherhood*.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":6407.3483943939,"scoring_ms":500.8790493011,"total_ms":6908.8973999023,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Fatherhood","total_tool_calls":4.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":2.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy.

During this time, both men developed a strong professional and personal friendship with one another.

During the course of filming Pesci broke one of his ribs.\n\nPesci won the [Film Award for Newcomer to Leading Film Roles](BAFTA)(BAFTA Film Award for Newcomer to Leading Film Roles) in 1981 and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Over the next few years, Pesci appeared in several smaller films, including *[Mr. Wonderful](Dear)(Dear Mr. Wonderful)* (1982), *[Eureka](Eureka (1983 film))* (1983) and *[Money](Easy)(Easy Money (1983 film))* (1983).\n\nIn 1984, he was cast in *[Upon a Time in America](Once)(Once Upon a Time in America)*, again appearing alongside De Niro. The following year he starred as private detective Rocky Nelson in the short-lived television comedy series *[Nelson](Half)(Half Nelson (TV series))*.\n\nIn 1988, Pesci appeared in the [Jackson](Michael)(Michael Jackson) musical anthology film *[Moonwalker](Moonwalker)*, in the film's sixth and longest segment, \"[Criminal](Smooth)(Smooth Criminal).\" He played the antagonist, crime boss Frankie \"Mr. Big\" LiDeo (an anagram for one of the film's producers and longtime Jackson manager [DiLeo](Frank)(Frank DiLeo), with whom Pesci later acted in *Goodfellas*).\n\nHe appeared as Leo Getz, a comedic sidekick and best friend to protagonist detectives Martin Riggs ([Gibson](Mel)(Mel Gibson)) and Roger Murtaugh ([Glover](Danny)(Danny Glover)) in the *[Weapon](Lethal)(Lethal Weapon (franchise))* sequels, released in [1989](Lethal Weapon 2), [1992](Lethal Weapon 3) and [1998](Lethal Weapon 4).\n\nIn 1990, he reunited with Scorsese and De Niro for *[Goodfellas](Goodfellas)*, in which he played mobster Tommy DeVito, based on real-life mobster [DeSimone](Thomas)(Thomas DeSimone) (Tommy DeVito also being the name of Pesci's old acquaintance from Belleville, New Jersey, and a member of The Four Seasons, but contrary to popular belief, the naming is coincidental). Pesci's old friend [Vincent](Frank)(Frank Vincent) also appears in the film. Pesci's character kills Vincent's character in a rage in one of the best-remembered scenes in the film after the Vincent character contemptuously tells him to \"go home and get your fucking shine box.\" According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography.\n\nFor example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him\u2014the \"Funny how? Do I amuse you?\" scene\u2014is based on an actual event that Pesci experienced. Pesci was working as a waiter when he thought he was making a compliment to a mobster by saying he was \"funny\"; however, the comment was not taken well. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script. The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised. Pesci received the [Award for Best Supporting Actor](Academy)(Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) for the role, which he accepted with one of the shortest speeches in Oscar history, saying simply, \"It's my privilege. Thank you\" before leaving the stage.\n\nPesci also co-starred in the blockbuster *[Alone](Home)(Home Alone)* in 1990, playing Harry Lyme, one of two bumbling burglars (along with good friend [Stern](Daniel)(Daniel Stern (actor))) who attempt to burgle the house of the young character played by [Culkin](Macaulay)(Macaulay Culkin). Pesci's use of \"cartoon cursing,\" or menacing gibberish, garnered comparisons to *[Tunes](Looney)(Looney Tunes)* character [Sam](Yosemite)(Yosemite Sam). Two years later, Pesci reprised his role in the sequel *[Alone 2: Lost in New York](Home)(Home Alone 2: Lost in New York)*.\n\nIn 1991, Pesci played [Ferrie](David)(David Ferrie) in *[JFK](JFK (film))*. In 1992, he appeared as the title character in the comedy *[Cousin Vinny](My)(My Cousin Vinny)* with [Macchio](Ralph)(Ralph Macchio), [Tomei](Marisa)(Marisa Tomei) and [Gwynne](Fred)(Fred Gwynne). During the same year Pesci headed up the cast of *[Public Eye](The)(The Public Eye (film))* as Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein, a photographer. His performance in the film, a departure from his usual characters, has been critically acclaimed.\n\nPesci hosted the sketch comedy show *[Night Live](Saturday)(Saturday Night Live)* on October 10, 1992, while doing publicity for *My Cousin Vinny*. During his monologue, he restored a picture of [John Paul II](Pope)(Pope John Paul II) that had been torn by [O'Connor](Sin\u00e9ad)(Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor) on the previous broadcast.\n\nIn 1993, Pesci made an appearance in *[Bronx Tale](A)(A Bronx Tale)* as Carmine. The film starred Robert De Niro, who also directed, and [Palminteri](Chazz)(Chazz Palminteri), who wrote the play from which the film was adapted. Both De Niro and Palminteri personally offered Pesci the role. In 1995, Pesci had his third collaboration with Scorsese and De Niro in the film *[Casino](Casino (1995 film))*, playing Nicky Santoro, based on real-life Mob enforcer [Spilotro](Anthony)(Anthony Spilotro), along with [Stone](Sharon)(Sharon Stone) and [Woods](James)(James Woods); Pesci had previously co-starred with the latter in *Once Upon a Time in America*. During filming, Pesci broke the same rib that had been broken 15 years prior during the production of *[Bull](Raging)(Raging Bull)*.

There is general agreement that it arose in the Southern United States \u2013 a region that would produce most of the major early rock and roll acts \u2013 through the meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the African musical tradition with European instrumentation.M.

According to Blum, true rock tracks from the 1940s included \"Rock Woogie\" by Jim Wynn's Bobalibans (1945), \"Rockin' the House\" by Memphis Slim and the House Rockers (1946), \"Aladdin Boogie\" by Amos Milburn (1947), \"Rock and Rye\" by Jimmy McCracklin (1947), \"We're Gonna Rock\" (1947) and \"Rock and Roll\" (1948) by Wild Bill Moore, and many others. His discussion of the topic is as follows:, text in both English pp17-18 and French pp 3-4.\n\nThe music was also called \"blues\" (*My Baby Left Me* by [Crudup](Arthur)(Arthur Crudup)), \"rhythm music\" (\"Hambone\" by [Saunders](Red)(Red Saunders (musician))), \"rhythm and blues\" (\"Honey Hush\" by [Joe Turner](Big)(Big Joe Turner)), \"R&B\" (the abbreviation of \"rhythm and blues\" and the name given to \"black\" music styles in the charts of Billboard magazine post-summer 1949), \"jump blues\" (\"Rock Around the Clock\" by [Singer](Hal)(Hal Singer)), \"big beat\", \"rock 'n' roll\" or \"race music\", was the label used by the press and Billboard in particular.}}\n\nIn the 1930s, [jazz](jazz), and particularly [swing](Swing music), both in urban-based dance bands and blues-influenced country swing ([Rodgers](Jimmie)(Jimmie Rodgers), [Mullican](Moon)(Moon Mullican) and other similar singers), were among the first music to present African-American sounds for a predominantly white audience.E. Wald, *How the Beatles Destroyed Rock N Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), pp. 111\u2013125. One particularly noteworthy example of a jazz song with recognizably rock and roll elements is [Joe Turner](Big)(Big Joe Turner) with pianist [Johnson](Pete)(Pete Johnson (musician))'s 1939 single \"['Em Pete](Roll)(Roll 'Em Pete)\", which is regarded as an important precursor of rock and roll.[Tosches](Nick)(Nick Tosches), ''Unsung Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll*, Secker & Warburg, 1991, Peter J.

The 1940s saw the increased use of blaring horns (including saxophones), shouted lyrics and boogie-woogie beats in jazz-based music. During and immediately after [War II](World)(World War II), with shortages of fuel and limitations on audiences and available personnel, large jazz bands were less economical and tended to be replaced by smaller combos, using guitars, bass and drums.P. D. Lopes, *The rise of a jazz art world* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 132 In the same period, particularly on the [Coast](West)(West Coast of the United States) and in the [Midwest](Midwestern United States), the development of [blues](jump)(jump blues), with its guitar riffs, prominent beats and shouted lyrics, prefigured many later developments. In the documentary film *[Hail! Rock 'n' Roll](Hail!)(Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll)*, [Richards](Keith)(Keith Richards) proposes that [Berry](Chuck)(Chuck Berry) developed his brand of rock and roll by transposing the familiar two-note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric guitar, creating what is instantly recognizable as rock guitar. This proposal by Richards neglects the black guitarists who did the same thing before Berry, such as [Carter](Goree)(Goree Carter),Robert Palmer, \"Church of the Sonic Guitar\", pp. 13\u201338 in Anthony DeCurtis, Present Tense, Duke University Press, 1992, p. 19. .

Denton: Texas State Historical Association. [boogie](Country)(Country boogie) and [electric blues](Chicago)(Chicago blues) supplied many of the elements that would be seen as characteristic of rock and roll. Inspired by [blues](electric)(electric blues), Chuck Berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to rock and roll, and established the electric guitar as its centerpiece,Michael Campbell & James Brody, *Rock and Roll: An Introduction*, [pp. 110\u2013111](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&pg=PA110)  adapting his rock band instrumentation from the basic blues band instrumentation of a lead guitar, second chord instrument, bass and drums.Michael Campbell & James Brody, [*Rock and Roll: An Introduction''](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&pg=PA80), , pp. 80\u201381. In 2017, [Christgau](Robert)(Robert Christgau) declared that \"Chuck Berry did in fact invent rock 'n' roll\", explaining that this artist \"came the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together\".\n\nRock and roll arrived at a time of considerable technological change, soon after the development of the electric guitar, [amplifier](amplifier) and [microphone](microphone), and the [rpm record](45)(45 rpm record). There were also changes in the record industry, with the rise of independent labels like [Atlantic](Atlantic records), [Sun](Sun Records) and [Chess](Chess Records) servicing [audiences](niche)(niche market) and a similar rise of radio stations that played their music. It was the realization that relatively affluent white teenagers were listening to this music that led to the development of what was to be defined as rock and roll as a distinct genre. Because the development of rock and roll was an evolutionary process, no single record can be identified as unambiguously \"the first\" rock and roll record.[Dawson](Jim)(Jim Dawson) and Steve Propes, ''[Was The First Rock'n'Roll Record](What)(iarchive:whatwasfirstrock0000daws)'', 1992,  Contenders for the title of \"[rock and roll record](first)(first rock and roll record)\" include [Rosetta Tharpe](Sister)(Sister Rosetta Tharpe)'s \"[Things Happening Every Day](Strange)(Strange Things Happening Every Day)\" (1944), \"[All Right](That's)(That's All Right)\" by [Crudup](Arthur)(Arthur Crudup) (1946),  \"[It On Over](Move)(Move It On Over (song))\" by [Williams](Hank)(Hank Williams) (1947), \"[Fat Man](The)(The Fat Man (song))\" by [Domino](Fats)(Fats Domino) (1949), [Carter](Goree)(Goree Carter)'s \"[Awhile](Rock)(Rock Awhile)\" (1949),[Palmer](Robert)(Robert Palmer (writer)), \"Church of the Sonic Guitar\", pp. 13\u201338 in Anthony DeCurtis, *Present Tense*, [University Press](Duke)(Duke University Press), 1992, p. 19.  and [Preston](Jimmy)(Jimmy Preston)'s \"[the Joint](Rock)(Rock the Joint)\" (1949) (later [covered](cover version) by [Haley & His Comets](Bill)(Bill Haley & His Comets) in 1952),\n\n\"[88](Rocket)(Rocket 88)\" by [Brenston](Jackie)(Jackie Brenston) and his Delta Cats ([Turner](Ike)(Ike Turner) and his band [Kings of Rhythm](The)(Kings of Rhythm) and sung by Brenston), was recorded by [Phillips](Sam)(Sam Phillips) in March 1951. This is often cited as the first rock n' roll record.M. Campbell, ed., *Popular Music in America: and the Beat Goes on* (Boston, Massachusetts: Cengage Learning, 3rd ed., 2008), , pp. 157\u20138. In an interview however, Ike Turner offered this comment: \"I don't think that 'Rocket 88' is rock 'n' roll. I think that 'Rocket 88' is R&B, but I think 'Rocket 88' is the cause of rock and roll existing\".\n\n[[File:BillHaley.JPG|upright=1.05|thumb|[Haley](Bill)(Bill Haley) and his Comets performing in the 1954 Universal International film *Round Up of Rhythm*]]\n\nIn terms of its wide cultural impact across society in the US and elsewhere, [Haley](Bill)(Bill Haley (musician))'s \"[Around the Clock](Rock)(Rock Around the Clock)\", recorded in April 1954 but not a commercial success until the following year, is generally recognized as an important milestone, but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements of rock and roll can be clearly discerned.Robert Palmer, \"Rock Begins\", in *[Stone](Rolling)(Rolling Stone) Illustrated History of Rock and Roll*, 1976\/1980,  (UK edition), pp. 3\u201314.\n\nJournalist [Petridis](Alexis)(Alexis Petridis) argued that neither Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\" nor Presley's version of \"That's Alright Mama\" heralded a new genre: \"They were simply the first white artists' interpretations of a sound already well-established by black musicians almost a decade before. It was a raucous, driving, unnamed variant of rhythm and blues that came complete with lyrics that talked about rocking\".\n\nOther artists with early rock and roll hits included [Berry](Chuck)(Chuck Berry), [Diddley](Bo)(Bo Diddley), [Richard](Little)(Little Richard), [Lee Lewis](Jerry)(Jerry Lee Lewis), and [Vincent](Gene)(Gene Vincent). Chuck Berry's 1955 classic \"[Maybellene](Maybellene)\" in particular features a [distorted](distortion (music)) [guitar](electric)(electric guitar) solo with warm [overtone](overtone)s created by his small [amplifier](valve)(valve amplifier). However, the use of distortion was predated by electric blues guitarists such as [Hill Louis](Joe)(Joe Hill Louis), [Slim](Guitar)(Guitar Slim),. [Johnson](Willie)(Willie Johnson (guitarist)) of [Wolf](Howlin')(Howlin' Wolf)'s band, and [Hare](Pat)(Pat Hare); the latter two also made use of distorted [chord](power)(power chord)s in the early 1950s.[Palmer](Robert)(Robert Palmer (writer)), \"Church of the Sonic Guitar\", pp. 13\u201338 in Anthony DeCurtis, *Present Tense*, [University Press](Duke)(Duke University Press), 1992, pp. 24\u201327. . Also in 1955, Bo Diddley introduced the \"[Diddley beat](Bo)(Bo Diddley beat)\" and a unique electric guitar style,P.

These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s.

After the mid-1950s, electric [guitar](bass)(bass guitar)s (\"Fender bass\") and [kits](drum)(drum kits) became popular in classic rock.S. Evans, \"The development of the Blues\" in A. F.

The eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue can be found by solving for the components of **v** in the equation  In this example, the eigenvectors are any nonzero scalar multiples of\n\n\\mathbf v_{\\lambda=1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf v_{\\lambda=3} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\nIf the entries of the matrix *A* are all real numbers, then the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial will also be real numbers, but the eigenvalues may still have nonzero imaginary parts. The entries of the corresponding eigenvectors therefore may also have nonzero imaginary parts. Similarly, the eigenvalues may be [number](irrational)(irrational number)s even if all the entries of *A* are [number](rational)(rational number)s or even if they are all integers. However, if the entries of *A* are all [number](algebraic)(algebraic number)s, which include the rationals, the eigenvalues must also be algebraic numbers (that is, they cannot magically become [number](transcendental)(transcendental number)s).\n\nThe non-real roots of a real polynomial with real coefficients can be grouped into pairs of [conjugate](complex)(complex conjugate)s, namely with the two members of each pair having imaginary parts that differ only in sign and the same real part. If the degree is odd, then by the [value theorem](intermediate)(intermediate value theorem) at least one of the roots is real. Therefore, any [matrix](real)(real matrix) with odd order has at least one real eigenvalue, whereas a real matrix with even order may not have any real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors associated with these complex eigenvalues are also complex and also appear in complex conjugate pairs.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The characteristic polynomial of the 2\u00d72 matrix $ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} $ is found by computing the determinant of $ A - \\lambda I $:\n\n$$\n\\det(A - \\lambda I) = \\begin{vmatrix} 2 - \\lambda & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 - \\lambda \\end{vmatrix} = (2 - \\lambda)(2 - \\lambda) - (1)(1) = \\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 3.\n$$\n\nThus, the characteristic polynomial is $ \\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 3 $.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":8250.1811981201,"scoring_ms":717.8225517273,"total_ms":8968.1036472321,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"(\u03bb - 3)(\u03bb - 1)","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in [literature](Arabic)(Arabic literature), and has significantly influenced the [language](Arabic)(Arabic language).\n\nMuslims believe that the Quran was orally revealed by God to the [prophet](final)(Khatam an-Nabiyyin), [Muhammad](Muhammad in Islam), through the archangel [Gabriel](Gabriel) incrementally over a period of some 23 years, beginning on [Al Qadr](Laylat)(Night of Power),[Quran 97:1-5](https:\/\/quran.com\/97) when Muhammad was 40; and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad's most important [miracle](miracle), a proof of his [prophethood](prophethood); and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to [Adam](Adam in Islam), including the [Tawrat](Tawrat), the [Zabur](Zabur) ([Psalms](Psalms)) and the [Injil](Injil) (Gospel). The word *Quran* occurs some 70 times in the text itself, and other names and words are also said to refer to the Quran.\n\nThe Quran is believed by Muslims to be not simply divinely inspired, but the literal [of God](word)(Biblical inspiration). Muhammad did not write it as he did not know how to write. In Muslim theology, the Qur'an is considered to be either \"[created](Quranic createdness)\" or \"uncreated\".[*Ibn \u1e24anbal and the Mi\u1e25na*, 1897](Patton,)(#WMP1897): p.54 According to tradition, several of Muhammad's [companions](Companions of the Prophet) served as scribes, recording the revelations. Shortly after the prophet's death, the Quran was compiled by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it. Caliph [Uthman](Uthman) established a standard version, now known as the [codex](Uthmanic)(Uthmanic codex), which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, [readings](variant)(Qira\u02bcat), with mostly minor differences in meaning.\n\nThe Quran assumes [with major narratives](familiarity)(Biblical and Quranic narratives) recounted in the [Biblical](Books of the Bible) and [scriptures](apocryphal)(Apocrypha). It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for humankind ( ). It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence. Supplementing the Quran with explanations for some cryptic Quranic narratives, and rulings that also provide the basis for Islamic law in most denominations of Islam, are *[hadith](hadith)s*\u2014oral and written traditions believed to describe words and actions of Muhammad.  During prayers, the Quran is recited only in [Arabic](Arabic).\n\nSomeone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a *[hafiz](Hafiz (Quran))*. Ideally, verses are recited with a special kind of [prosody](Prosody (linguistics)) reserved for this purpose, called *[tajwid](tajwid)*. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during *[tarawih](tarawih)* prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, Muslims rely on [exegesis](exegesis), or commentary rather than a direct translation of the text.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-29165c39a30648108ec68af2ec8ece30\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"quran:contents\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"## Contents\n\nThe Quranic content is concerned with basic Islamic beliefs including the existence of [God](God in Islam) and the [resurrection](Islamic eschatology).

The Quranic verses contain general exhortations regarding right and wrong and historical events are related to outline general moral lessons. Verses pertaining to natural phenomena have been interpreted by Muslims as an indication of the authenticity of the Quranic message.

Thereafter, he received revelations over a period of 23 years. According to *[hadith](hadith)* and [history](Muslim)(History of Islam), after Muhammad [to Medina](immigrated)(Hijra (Islam)) and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his [companions](sahabah) to recite the Quran and to learn and teach the laws, which were revealed daily. It is related that some of the [Quraysh](Quraysh) who were taken prisoners at the [of Badr](Battle)(Battle of Badr) regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time. Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate. As it was initially spoken, the Quran was recorded on tablets, bones, and the wide, flat ends of date palm fronds. Most suras were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both [Sunni](Sunni) and [Shia](Shia) sources, relating Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, the making of prayer and the manner of recitation. However, the Quran did not exist in book form at the time of Muhammad's death in 632. There is agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write down the revelation.\n\n*[al-Bukhari](Sahih)(Sahih al-Bukhari)* narrates Muhammad describing the revelations as, \"Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell\" and [Aisha](Aisha) reported, \"I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).\"|group=lower-roman}} Muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was accompanied with a vision. The agent of revelation is mentioned as the \"one mighty in power,\" the one who \"grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer.\" The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the *[of Islam](Encyclopaedia)(Encyclopaedia of Islam)* that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a [soothsayer](Clairvoyant) or a [magician](magician (paranormal)) since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in [Arabia](ancient)(Pre-Islamic Arabia). Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood.\n\n[[File:Iqra.jpg|thumb|200px|[Muhammad](Muhammad)'s first revelation, [Al-Alaq](Surah)(Al-Alaq), later placed 96th in the Qur'anic regulations, in current writing style]]\n\nThe Quran describes Muhammad as \",\" which is traditionally interpreted as 'illiterate', but the meaning is rather more complex. Medieval commentators such as [Al-Tabari](Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari) maintained that the term induced two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; second, the inexperience or ignorance of the previous books or scriptures (but they gave priority to the first meaning). Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood. For example, according to [al-Din al-Razi](Fakhr)(Fakhr al-Din al-Razi), if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading he possibly would have been suspected of having studied the books of the ancestors. Some scholars such as [Watt](William Montgomery Watt) prefer the second meaning of \u2014they take it to indicate unfamiliarity with earlier sacred texts.\n\nThe final verse of the Quran was revealed on the 18th of the Islamic month of [al-Hijjah](Dhu)(Dhu al-Hijjah) in the year 10 [A.H.](Hijri year), a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632.

For them, it is an essential idea that the Quran also has inward aspects. [Corbin](Henry)(Henry Corbin) narrates a *[hadith](hadith)* that goes back to [Muhammad](Muhammad):\n\nThe Quran possesses an external appearance and a hidden depth, an exoteric meaning and an esoteric meaning. This esoteric meaning in turn conceals an esoteric meaning (this depth possesses a depth, after the image of the celestial Spheres, which are enclosed within each other). So it goes on for seven esoteric meanings (seven depths of hidden depth).\n\nAccording to this view, it has also become evident that the inner meaning of the Quran does not eradicate or invalidate its outward meaning. Rather, it is like the soul, which gives life to the body. Corbin considers the Quran to play a part in [philosophy](Islamic)(Islamic philosophy), because [gnosiology](gnosiology) itself goes hand in hand with [prophetology](prophet#Islam).\n\nCommentaries dealing with the *[zahir](Zahir (Islam))* ('outward aspects') of the text are called , and hermeneutic and esoteric commentaries dealing with the *[batin](Batin (Islam))* are called ''[ta'wil](Esoteric interpretation of the Quran)'' ('interpretation' or 'explanation'), which involves taking the text back to its beginning. Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God. In contrast, [literalism](Quranic)(Bi-la kaifa), followed by [Salafis](Salafis) and [Zahiri](Zahiri)s, is the belief that the Quran should only be taken at its apparent meaning.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-0582384b0b5d4901950039489b990251\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"quran:etymology_and_meaning\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"## Etymology and meaning\n\nThe word  appears about 70 times in the Quran itself, assuming various meanings. It is a [noun](verbal)(verbal noun) ([[verbs#Verbal noun (ma\u1e63dar)|](Arabic)]) of the [Arabic](Arabic language) verb  () meaning 'he read' or 'he recited'. The [Syriac](Syriac language) equivalent is  (), which refers to 'scripture reading' or 'lesson'. While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the origin of the word is  itself. Regardless, it had become an Arabic term by Muhammad's lifetime. An important meaning of the word is the 'act of reciting', as reflected in an early Quranic passage: \"It is for Us to collect it and to recite it ().\"\n\nIn other verses, the word refers to 'an individual passage recited [Muhammad](by)'. Its [liturgical](liturgy) context is seen in a number of passages, for example: *\"So when  is recited, listen to it and keep silent.\"* The word may also assume the meaning of a codified scripture when mentioned with other scriptures such as the [Torah](Tawrat) and [Gospel](Injil).See \"\u0136ur'an, al-\", *Encyclopedia of Islam Online* and\n\nThe term also has closely related [synonym](synonym)s that are employed throughout the Quran. Each synonym possesses its own distinct meaning, but its use may converge with that of  in certain contexts. Such terms include  ('book'),  ('sign'), and  ('scripture'); the latter two terms also denote units of revelation. In the large majority of contexts, usually with a [article](definite)(definite article) (*al-*), the word is referred to as the *[wa\u1e25y](wahy)* ('revelation'), that which has been \"sent down\" (*[tanz\u012bl](tanzil)*) at intervals. cf. cf. Other related words include:  ('remembrance'), used to refer to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning; and  ('wisdom'), sometimes referring to the revelation or part of it.\n\nThe Quran describes itself as 'the discernment' (), 'the mother book' (), 'the guide' (), 'the wisdom' (), 'the remembrance' (), and 'the revelation' (; 'something sent down', signifying the descent of an object from a higher place to lower place). Another term is  ('The Book'), though it is also used in the Arabic language for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Gospels.

She had an excellent [humanist](Renaissance humanism) education, and a reputation as one of the most learned young women of her day. In May 1553, she married [Guildford Dudley](Lord)(Lord Guildford Dudley), a younger son of Edward's chief minister [Dudley, Duke of Northumberland](John)(John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland). In June 1553, Edward VI wrote his will, nominating Jane and her male heirs as successors to the Crown, in part because his half-sister [Mary](Mary I of England) was Catholic, while Jane was a committed Protestant and would support the reformed [of England](Church)(Church of England), whose foundation Edward laid. The will removed his half-sisters, Mary and [Elizabeth](Elizabeth I), from the line of succession on account of their illegitimacy, subverting their claims under the [Succession Act](Third)(Third Succession Act).\n\nAfter Edward's death, Jane was proclaimed queen on 10 July 1553, and awaited coronation in the [of London](Tower)(Tower of London). Support for Mary grew quickly, and most of Jane's supporters abandoned her. The [Council of England](Privy)(Privy Council of England) suddenly changed sides, and proclaimed Mary as queen on 19 July 1553, deposing Jane. Her primary supporter, her father-in-law, the Duke of Northumberland, was accused of treason, and executed less than a month later. Jane was held prisoner in the Tower, and was convicted of high treason in November 1553, which carried a sentence of death.\n\nMary initially spared her life; however, Jane soon became viewed as a threat to the Crown when her father, [Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk](Henry)(Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk), became involved with [rebellion](Wyatt's)(Wyatt's rebellion) against Queen Mary's intention to marry [of Spain](Philip)(Philip II of Spain). Jane and her husband were executed on 12 February 1554. At the time of her death, Jane was either 16 or 17 years old.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-071c3db9cec44d02810a68973a0805d2\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"lady_jane_grey:trial_and_execution\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"## Trial and execution\n\nReferred to by the court as Jane Dudley, wife of Guildford, Jane was charged with [treason](high)(high treason), as were her husband, two of his brothers, and the former [of Canterbury](archbishop)(archbishop of Canterbury), [Cranmer](Thomas)(Thomas Cranmer). Their trial, by a special commission, took place on 13 November 1553, at [Guildhall](Guildhall, London) in the [of London](City)(City of London). The commission was chaired by [Thomas White](Sir)(Thomas White (merchant)), [Mayor of London](Lord)(Lord Mayor of London), and [Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk](Thomas)(Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk). Other members included [Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby](Edward)(Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby), and [Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath](John)(John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath). As was to be expected, all defendants were found guilty and sentenced to death. Jane's guilt, of having treacherously assumed the title and the power of the monarch, was evidenced by a number of documents she had signed as \"Jane the Quene\". Her sentence was to \"be burned alive on [Hill](Tower)(Tower Hill) or beheaded as the Queen pleases\" ([burning](Execution by burning#Historical usage) was the [English punishment](traditional)(Burning of women in England) for [treason](treason) committed by women).;  The [ambassador](imperial)(List of ambassadors of the Holy Roman Empire to England) reported to [V, Holy Roman Emperor](Charles)(Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor), that her life was to be spared.\n\n[[File:Lady Jane Grey letter as Queen.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Official letter of Lady Jane Grey signing herself as \"Jane the Quene\". [Temple Library](Inner)(Inner Temple Library), London]]\n\n[rebellion](Wyatt's)(Wyatt's rebellion) in January 1554 against [Mary's marriage plans](Queen)(wedding of Mary I of England and Philip of Spain) with [of Spain](Philip)(Philip II of Spain) sealed Jane's fate. Her father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and his two brothers joined the rebellion, and so the government decided to go through with the verdict against Jane and Guildford. Their execution was first scheduled for 9 February 1554, but was then postponed for three days to give Jane a chance to convert to the Catholic faith. Mary sent her chaplain [Feckenham](John)(John Feckenham) to Jane, who was initially not pleased about this. Though she would not give in to his efforts \"to save her soul\", she became friends with him and allowed him to accompany her to the scaffold.\n\nOn the morning of 12 February 1554, the authorities took Guildford from his rooms at the Tower of London to the public [execution](execution) place at Tower Hill, where he was beheaded. A horse and cart brought his remains back to the Tower, past the rooms where Jane was staying. Seeing her husband's corpse return, Jane is reported to have exclaimed: \"Oh, Guildford, Guildford.\" She was then taken out to [Green](Tower)(Tower Green), inside the Tower, to be beheaded. According to the account of her execution given in the anonymous *Chronicle of Queen Jane and of Two Years of Queen Mary*, which formed the basis for [Holinshed](Raphael)(Raphael Holinshed)'s depiction, Jane gave a speech upon ascending the scaffold:\n\nGood people, I am come hither to die, and by a law I am condemned to the same. The fact, indeed, against the Queen's highness was unlawful, and the consenting thereunto by me: but touching the procurement and desire thereof by me or on my behalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocency, before God, and the face of you, good Christian people, this day.\n\nWhile admitting to action considered unlawful, she declared that \"I do wash my hands thereof in innocence\". Jane then recited [51](Psalm)(Psalm 51) (*Have mercy upon me, O God*) in English, and handed her gloves and handkerchief to her maid. The executioner asked her forgiveness, which she granted him, pleading: \"I pray you dispatch me quickly.\" Referring to her head, she asked, \"Will you take it off before I lay me down?\", and the axeman answered: \"No, madam.\" She then blindfolded herself. Jane then failed to find the block with her hands, and cried, \"What shall I do? Where is it?\" Probably [Thomas Brydges](Sir)(Thomas Brydges), the Deputy Lieutenant of the Tower, helped her find her way. With her head on the block, Jane spoke the last words of Jesus as recounted by [Luke](Gospel of Luke): \"Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!\" The axe then fell and Jane was beheaded in one clean stroke.\n\nJane and Guildford are buried in the Chapel of [Peter ad Vincula](St)(Church of St Peter ad Vincula) on the north side of Tower Green. No memorial stone was erected at their grave. Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, was executed 11 days after Jane, on 23 February 1554. Her mother, the Duchess of Suffolk, married her Master of the Horse and [chamberlain](Chamberlain (office)), [Stokes](Adrian)(Adrian Stokes (Master of Horse)), in March 1555. She was fully pardoned by Mary and allowed to live at Court with her two surviving daughters. She died in 1559.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Lady Jane Grey was imprisoned in the Tower of London before her execution.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":3607.3634624481,"scoring_ms":330.5852413177,"total_ms":3938.2383823395,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Tower of London","total_tool_calls":4.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":2.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Garnett's name was mentioned in various trade rumors involving the [Bulls](Chicago)(Chicago Bulls), [Angeles Lakers](Los)(Los Angeles Lakers), [State Warriors](Golden)(Golden State Warriors), [Pacers](Indiana)(Indiana Pacers), [Celtics](Boston)(Boston Celtics), [Suns](Phoenix)(Phoenix Suns), and [Mavericks](Dallas)(Dallas Mavericks). Garnett later confirmed that his preferred trade destinations were the Lakers, Celtics, and Suns. He had initially contacted Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant about joining the team as the Lakers were his initial top choice but Bryant didn't answer or return the calls. Garnett stated, \"I'm just being honest with everybody. I wanted to link with Kobe. Kobe and I had a different connect. When Kobe-Shaq went on their little thing, a lot of people went with Shaq. A lot of people didn't even fuck with Kobe. You know, Kobe, whatever. One of the very few to just stay with him. I was a neutral guy, anyway. I show everybody love. I tried to link with him, and I couldn't get him on the line.\" The Lakers originally had a trade framework in place that involved [Odom](Lamar)(Lamar Odom) and [Bynum](Andrew)(Andrew Bynum).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Kevin Garnett joined the Boston Celtics in 2007 in a blockbuster trade after 12 seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":7158.7905883789,"scoring_ms":455.52277565,"total_ms":7615.4170036316,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Boston Celtics","total_tool_calls":4.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":2.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Timestamp: 2023-05-30T20:04:27Z*\n\n---\n\n**Human sexual activity**, **human sexual practice** or **human sexual behaviour** is the manner in which [human](human)s experience and express their [sexuality](Human sexuality). People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., [masturbation](masturbation)) to acts with another person (e.g., [intercourse](sexual)(sexual intercourse), [sex](non-penetrative)(non-penetrative sex), [sex](oral)(oral sex), etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in [arousal](sexual)(sexual arousal) and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the [life](sex)(sex life) of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([courtship](courtship) and [display](Display (zoology)) behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, [foreplay](foreplay) or [BDSM](BDSM)). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.\n\nHuman sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [emotional](Emotional intimacy), [behavioural](Physical intimacy) and biological aspects; these include [bonding](personal)(Human bonding), sharing emotions and the [physiology](physiology) of the [system](reproductive)(reproductive system), [drive](sex)(sex drive), sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.\n\nIn some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within [marriage](marriage), while [premarital](Premarital sex) and [sex](extramarital)(extramarital sex) are [taboo](taboo). Some [activities are illegal](sexual)(Sex and the law) either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the [norm](Norm (social))s of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most [jurisdiction](jurisdiction)s are [assault](sexual)(sexual assault) and sexual activity with a person below the local [of consent](age)(age of consent).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-b887a8b211dc47a88f82319966d7926d\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"human_sexual_activity:types\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"## Types\n\nSexual activity can be classified in a number of ways. The practices may be preceded by or consist solely of [foreplay](foreplay). Acts which involve one person (also called [autoeroticism](autoeroticism)) may include [fantasy](sexual)(sexual fantasy) or [masturbation](masturbation). If two or more people are involved, they may engage in vaginal sex, [sex](anal)(anal sex), [sex](oral)(oral sex) or [masturbation](mutual)(mutual masturbation). [sex](Penetrative)(Sexual penetration) between two people may be described as [intercourse](sexual)(sexual intercourse), but definitions vary. If there are more than two participants in a sex act, it may be referred to as [sex](group)(group sex). Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of [dildo](dildo)s, [vibrator](Vibrator (sex toy))s, [plug](butt)(butt plug)s, and other [toy](sex)(sex toy)s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.\n\nSexual activity can be classified into the [gender](gender) and [orientation](sexual)(sexual orientation) of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. The relationships can be ones of marriage, [partner](intimate)(intimate partner)s, casual [partners](sex)(sex partners) or [anonymous](anonymous sex). Sexual activity can be regarded as [conventional](conventional sex) or as [alternative](Kink (sexual)), involving, for example, [fetishism](Sexual fetishism) or [BDSM](BDSM) activities.\n\nFetishism can take many forms, including the desire for certain body parts ([partialism](partialism)) such as [breasts](Breast fetishism), [navels](Navel fetishism), or [feet](Foot fetishism). The object of desire can be [shoes](Shoe fetishism), [boots](Boot fetishism), [lingerie](lingerie), [clothing](Clothing fetish), [leather](Leather subculture) or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include [asphyxiation](autoerotic)(erotic asphyxiation) and [self-bondage](self-bondage). The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes (choking and [bondage](Bondage (sexual)), respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.\n\nSexual activity that is consensual is sexual activity in which both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent. If sexual activity takes place under force or duress, it is considered [rape](rape) or another form of [assault](sexual)(sexual assault). In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, [status](marital)(Adultery laws) or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to [norms](social)(social norms) or generally accepted [morals](sexual)(sexual morals).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-4904dd76fec44ceca675e1075a766f77\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"human_sexual_activity:sexual_arousal\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Section not found: human_sexual_activity:sexual_arousal","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-563cec4e738845ad852c561fc29814d3\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"human_sexual_activity:stages_of_physiological_arousal_during_sexual_stimulation\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"## Stages of physiological arousal during sexual stimulation\n\n[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Indian [sutra](Kama)(Kama sutra) illustration, which shows a woman on top of a man, depicts the male erection, which is one of the physiological responses to sexual arousal for men.]]\n\nThe [responses](physiological)(Human sexual response cycle) during [stimulation](sexual)(sexual stimulation) are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.\n\n* During the excitement phase, muscle tension and blood flow increase in and around the sexual organs, heart and respiration increase and blood pressure rises. Men and women experience a \"[flush](sex)(sex flush)\" on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a woman's [vagina](vagina) becomes lubricated and her [clitoris](clitoris) becomes swollen. A man's [penis](penis) will become erect.\n\n* During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further. A man's urinary bladder closes to prevent urine from mixing with [semen](semen). A woman's clitoris may withdraw slightly and there is more lubrication, outer swelling and muscles tighten and reduction of diameter.\n\n* During the [orgasm](orgasm) phase, breathing becomes extremely rapid and the pelvic muscles begin a series of rhythmic contractions. Both men and women experience quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience can be described as intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm, and half report having [it](faked)(Fake orgasm). A large genetic component is associated with how often women experience orgasm.\n\n* During the resolution phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, and the body returns to its resting state. Though generally reported that women do not experience a [period](refractory)(Refractory period (sex)) and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms soon after the first, some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. This period may last from minutes to days and is typically longer for men than women.\n\n[dysfunction](Sexual)(Sexual dysfunction) is the inability to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stages in the sexual response cycles, which are desire, excitement and orgasm.Kontula, O & Mannila, E (2009).

In humans, it extends from the [vestibule](Vulval vestibule) to the [cervix](cervix). The outer vaginal opening is normally partly covered by a thin layer of [tissue](mucosal)(mucous membrane) called the [hymen](hymen). At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the [uterus](uterus)) bulges into the vagina. The vagina allows for [intercourse](sexual)(sexual intercourse) and [birth](birth).  It also channels [flow](menstrual)(Menstruation), which occurs in humans and closely related [primate](primate)s as part of the [cycle](menstrual)(menstrual cycle).\n\nAlthough research on the vagina is especially lacking for different animals, its location, structure and size are documented as varying among species. Female mammals usually have two external openings in the [vulva](vulva); these are the [urethral](urethral) opening for the [tract](urinary)(urinary tract) and the vaginal opening for the genital tract. This is different from male mammals, who usually have a single [opening](urethral)(Urinary meatus) for both [urination](urination) and [reproduction](reproduction). The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the [labia](labia) in humans. In [amphibian](amphibian)s, [bird](bird)s, [reptile](reptile)s and [monotreme](monotreme)s, the [cloaca](cloaca) is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal, urinary, and reproductive tracts.\n\nTo accommodate smoother penetration of the vagina during sexual intercourse or other [activity](sexual)(sexual activity), vaginal moisture increases during [arousal](sexual)(sexual arousal) in human females and other female mammals. This increase in moisture provides [lubrication](vaginal)(vaginal lubrication), which reduces friction. The texture of the vaginal walls creates friction for the [penis](penis) during sexual intercourse and stimulates it toward [ejaculation](ejaculation), enabling [fertilization](fertilization). Along with pleasure and bonding, women's sexual behavior with others (which can include [heterosexual](heterosexual) or [lesbian](lesbian) sexual activity) can result in [transmitted infections](sexually)(Sexually transmitted disease) (STIs), the risk of which can be reduced by recommended [sex](safe)(safe sex) practices. [health issues](Other)(#Infections, diseases, and safe sex) may also affect the human vagina.\n\nThe vagina and vulva have evoked strong reactions in societies throughout history, including negative perceptions and language, cultural [taboo](taboo)s, and their use as symbols for [sexuality](female)(female sexuality), spirituality, or regeneration of life. [common speech](In)(Colloquialism), the word *vagina* is often used to refer to the vulva or to the female genitals in general. By its dictionary and anatomical definitions, however, *vagina* refers exclusively to the specific internal structure, and understanding the distinction can improve knowledge of the female genitalia and aid in healthcare communication.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-5f90fb4b5c7641219e721a60a6c27c10\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"human_sexual_activity:psychological_aspects\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"## Psychological aspects\n\nSexual activity can lower blood pressure and overall stress levels.

Although Hong Taiji was an experienced leader and the commander of two Banners, the Jurchens suffered defeat in 1627, in part due to the Ming's newly acquired Portuguese cannons. To redress the technological and numerical disparity, Hong Taiji in 1634 created his own artillery corps from his existing Han troops, who cast their own cannons in the European design with the help of defector Chinese metallurgists. One of the defining events of Hong Taiji's reign was the official adoption of the name \"Manchu\" for the united Jurchen people in November 1635. In 1635, the Manchus' Mongol allies were fully incorporated into a separate Banner hierarchy under direct Manchu command. In April 1636, [nobility](Mongol)(Mongolian nobility) of Inner Mongolia, Manchu nobility and the [mandarin](Han)(Mandarin (bureaucrat)) recommended that Hong as the khan of Later Jin should be the emperor of the Great Qing.Tumen jalafun jecen ak\u016b: Manchu studies in honour of Giovanni Stary By Giovanni Stary, Alessandra Pozzi, Juha Antero Janhunen, Michael Weiers When he was presented with the [seal](imperial)(Imperial Seal of China) of the Yuan dynasty after the defeat of the last [Khagan](Khagan) of the Mongols, Hong Taiji renamed his state from \"Great Jin\" to \"Great Qing\" and elevated his position from Khan to [Emperor](Emperor of China), suggesting imperial ambitions beyond unifying the Manchu territories. Hong Taiji then proceeded to [Korea](invade)(Second Manchu invasion of Korea) again in 1636.\n\n[[File:Sura han ni chiha. Currency of the farther East. No.850.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|*Sura han ni chiha* (Coins of [Khan](Tiancong)(Hong Taiji)) in [alphabet](Manchu)(Manchu alphabet)]]\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Taiji set up a rudimentary bureaucratic system based on the Ming model. He established six boards or executive level ministries in 1631 to oversee finance, personnel, rites, military, punishments, and public works. However, these administrative organs had very little role initially, and it was not until the eve of completing the conquest ten years later that they fulfilled their government roles.\n\nHong Taiji staffed his bureaucracy with many Han Chinese, including newly surrendered Ming officials, but ensured Manchu dominance by an ethnic quota for top appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong according to how much grain they had: those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated badly, while those with more were rewarded with property. Due to a Han revolt in 1623, Nurhaci turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted and enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them. He ordered that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally with Jurchens, not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji recognized the need to attract Han Chinese, explaining to reluctant Manchus why he needed to treat the Ming defector General [Chengchou](Hong)(Hong Chengchou) leniently.

During the production of the film, Duncan became friends with castmate [Willis](Bruce)(Bruce Willis), and it was Willis' influence that helped him to get his breakout role as gentle giant John Coffey in the [Darabont](Frank)(Frank Darabont) film *[Green Mile](The)(The Green Mile (film))* (1999). Starring with [Hanks](Tom)(Tom Hanks), Duncan's performance netted him an [Award](Academy)(Academy Award) nomination for [Actor in a Supporting Role](Best)(Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) and a [Globe](Golden)(Golden Globe Award) nomination for [Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture](Best)(Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture).s giant has taken massive strides|publisher=CNN}}\n\nFollowing his role as Coffey, Duncan was then cast in a string of films that helped to establish him as an actor in both action and comedy roles: *[Whole Nine Yards](The)(The Whole Nine Yards (film))* (2000), *[Spot Run](See)(See Spot Run)* (2001), *[of the Apes](Planet)(Planet of the Apes (2001 film))* (2001), *[Scorpion King](The)(The Scorpion King)* (2002), and *[Daredevil](Daredevil (film))* (2003), and in the latter movie, he played [Kingpin](Kingpin (character)).\n\nWhen Duncan was cast as the Kingpin in 2002, he faced the dual challenge of portraying a typically white character and having to gain  to fit the character's large physique. In July 2006, Duncan showed interest in returning for the role of the Kingpin, but stated that he would not be willing to regain the weight that he had lost. In 2009, he stopped eating meat and later appeared in a [PETA](People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) ad campaign, touting the health benefits and his increased strength from a [diet](vegetarian)(vegetarianism).\"[Green Mile Star Joins Veggie Campaign](http:\/\/www.kshb.com\/dpp\/entertainment\/celebrity\/Green-Mile-star-joins-veggie-campaign_23162602)\" , KSHB.com, May 12, 2012.\n\nIn 2005, Duncan appeared in *[Island](The)(The Island (2005 film))* and *[City](Sin)(Sin City (film))*, in which he played Manute, a powerful mobster.

Realizing that they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N' Roses, they decided to form a new band together.

[Kushner](Dave)(Dave Kushner), who had previously played with McKagan in [Loaded](Loaded (band)), then joined the band on rhythm guitar.
