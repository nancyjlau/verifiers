Bethesda advertised that the edition would include a [canvas](canvas) [bag](duffel)(duffel bag), but a [nylon](nylon) one was included instead. Responding to customer complaints, Bethesda claimed that the bag had to be changed due to unavailability of materials, and initially stated the intention to take no action. The publisher received criticism for not making the change known beforehand, with *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* pointing out that the bag's description on Bethesda's website had only changed to read \"nylon\" after complaints had been submitted. Bethesda later offered affected customers free in-game currency of 500 atoms as compensation, equivalent to . Critics pointed out this amount of currency was not enough to purchase the in-game postman uniform (700 atoms), which includes a canvas bag. Additionally, it was discovered that Bethesda had produced a different *Fallout 76*\u2013themed canvas bag and given them for free to [influencers](online)(Internet celebrity), further adding to the fan outrage. Bethesda announced on December 3, 2018, that they would be producing canvas bags for all owners of the Power Armor special edition, which were ultimately said to be shipping \"in four to six months.\" In June 2019, the bags were delivered to customers.\n\nA [breach](data)(data breach) occurred on December 5, 2018, when a [glitch](glitch) in Bethesda's [system](support)(Issue tracking system) revealed personal information of approximately 65 *Fallout 76* customers who had submitted a support ticket to receive the canvas bag. Users were able to open and close tickets of other customers and view personal information, including names, addresses, emails and partial credit card information. In a statement given to *[Technica](Ars)(Ars Technica)*, Bethesda said that the breach occurred via \"an error with our customer support website\" and that they are \"investigating the incident and will provide additional updates as we learn more\". The publisher clarified that the only information leaked were details that the support site would have requested, rather than credit card numbers or passwords, and that they would notify all affected customers.\n\nIn 2018, Bethesda partnered with the Silver Screen Bottling Company to create \"Nuka Dark Rum\", an alcoholic beverage based on the in-game \"Nuka-Cola Dark\" introduced in the *[4: Nuka-World](Fallout)(Fallout 4: Nuka-World)* [add-on](Downloadable content). The rum was available to be pre-ordered in August 2018 for . While its release was expected to coincide with the launch of *Fallout 76*, the rum was delayed and was shipped instead in late December 2018. Upon receiving it, fans criticized the fact that the rum bottle advertised, previously expected to be a bottle in the missile-like shape of the in-game Nuka-Cola item, had turned out to be a standard glass bottle encased in a large plastic cover. The rum's asking price of $80 was subsequently condemned from expectations that the design would be of high quality, since none of the marketing had stated what the bottles would be made of.\n\nIn September 2019, collectible \"Nuka Cola\"\u2013themed *Fallout* helmets produced by Chronicle Collectibles, of which only 32 of the 20,000 manufactured were sold, were recalled by the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](U.S.)(U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) due to containing high levels of mold and posing a health risk. No incidents or injuries were reported. [GameStop](GameStop), which sold the helmets, notified all customers who had purchased a helmet and offered them a full refund.\n\nIn June 2022, a *Kotaku* article published reports from ten anonymous former employees of Bethesda and its parent company [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) of severe mismanagement during *Fallout 76*s development. The reports claimed that [crunch](Crunch (video games)) had been enforced, leading to an \"exodus\" of senior developers from the company. The loss of staff led to Bethesda borrowing developers working on [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios)' *[Redfall](Redfall)* and Bethesda's *[Starfield](Starfield (video game))* to assist with *Fallout 76*. Other alleged issues included technical problems with the game's design and engine, as well as these concerns being ignored by senior management. The sources expressed cynicism towards an improvement of working conditions at Bethesda (following their acquisition by Microsoft), saying \"It would be great if something like [ABetterABK](ABK Workers Alliance) existed for Bethesda [...] But everyone is terrified...because [Bethesda] HR is super cutthroat.\"\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"It was about the Power Armor Edition\u2019s included canvas bag.

British authorities acted in 1912 to free the [mine](Carrock)(Carrock Fell) from the German owned Cumbrian Mining Company and, during [War I](World)(World War I), restrict German access elsewhere. In [War II](World)(World War II), tungsten played a more significant role in [political dealings.](background)(Wolfram Crisis) Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was [under pressure from both sides](put)(Portugal during World War II#Wolfram (Tungsten)), because of its deposits of wolframite ore at [Panasqueira](Panasqueira). Tungsten's desirable properties such as resistance to high temperatures, its hardness and density, and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry, both as a constituent of weapons and equipment and employed in production itself, e.g., in [carbide](tungsten)(tungsten carbide) cutting tools for machining steel.\n\nNow tungsten is used in many more applications such as aircraft & motorsport ballast weights, darts, anti-vibration tooling, and sporting equipment.\n\nTungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings. In 1928, a US court rejected [Electric](General)(General Electric)'s attempt to patent it, overturning  granted in 1913 to [D. Coolidge](William)(William D. Coolidge).General Electric Co. v.

Before meeting Edward, Martin reveals to the warden, Moss, that he was brought in to fill in for Dr. Stewart, who was Edward's regular visitor for this procedure. Stewart had died by suicide the night before, causing Martin to replace him. Edward is scheduled to die via electrocution at his insistence that very day and Moss explains to Martin that Edward's fate depends upon Martin's diagnosis; if Martin deduces that Edward is sane, he will be executed, but if Martin declares him insane with multi-personality disorder as Stewart had believed, Edward will be spared.\n\nWhen Martin takes a seat to interrogate Edward, the inmate refuses to be identified as a human and instead a demon inhabiting Edward's body named \"Nefariamous,\" a name Satan gave him  \"Nefarious\" for short. Martin does not believe Nefarious is who he says he is and thinks instead that it is an act by Edward to seem insane; however, he is surprised when Nefarious insists that he wants to be executed, or rather, that he wants Edward to be executed. Nefarious also explains that before the day is over, Martin will commit three murders.\n\nMartin, an atheist, balks at this idea but plays along, asking Nefarious how he came to inhabit Edward. Nefarious explains that he possessed Edward through a process carried out through Edward\u2019s life, beginning with ease of access through Edward\u2019s never having been [baptized](baptized), continuing through seemingly innocuous events such as Edward\u2019s grandmother having given him a [board](ouija)(ouija board) as a present, allowing manipulative communication, finally completing the process only after Edward consented to the possession multiple times. Martin brings in a chaplain to confront the demon in Edward, which frightens Nefarious until he realizes that the priest does not believe in demons and therefore has no effect on him. Martin then asks to talk to Edward, causing Nefarious to recede and produce a timid, childlike Edward who is terribly distraught and shaken by his possession. Edward insists that he is possessed and that the demon had murdered multiple people using his innocent body as a vessel.\n\nWhen Martin begins probing further, Nefarious takes control and insists that Martin euthanized his terminally ill mother to acquire her massive wealth. Martin becomes angry and threatens to leave the meeting, but changes his mind. When Martin decides to write Nefarious off as insane, Nefarious explains that Martin's girlfriend is pregnant, and because Martin threatened to leave her, she is terminating her pregnancy. Overcome with curiosity, Martin begs a kindly prison guard for access to a phone, which he uses to call the health clinic from where he realizes his girlfriend has just finished with the abortion. Nefarious cackles with glee, explaining to Martin that \"all hell is rejoicing.\"\n\nMartin still remains doubtful Nefarious is possessed, but is fully intrigued to hear what the inmate has to tell him. After Martin insists that the world is reclaiming the moral high ground, Nefarious laughs before telling him there is currently an influx of slavery and human trafficking which the demons are helping with. Nefarious then explains he wants Martin to write a book called *The Dark Gospel*, which is his Satanic equivalent to the Bible and will begin another world religion in servitude to demons. Martin is called away by Warden Moss who reveals to him that upon searching Edward's prison cell, they found documentation of Martin's life as Nefarious had done with all his other victims, as well as the dark gospel which Edward wrote, crediting it to Martin's name. Martin, now believing Edward is faking split personalities, confronts Nefarious about this. Nefarious breaks his own hand to slip free of one of the cuffs and seizes Martin, threatening to break his neck unless Martin begs for his life. Overcome with terror, Martin begs Nefarious to spare him to which Nefarious complies before being beaten down by the prison guards. Instinctively, Martin declares that Edward is sane, but not before being warned by a triumphant Nefarious that he is condemning Edward to death.\n\nAs Edward is in the electric chair, Nefarious possesses his body for a final time, asking if Martin accepts his offer, to which Martin silently refuses. Disappointed, Nefarious leaves Edward's body, causing Edward to suffer an extremely painful and terrible death in the chair. The demon then tells Martin, \"You should have accepted my offer,\" before possessing him and trying to force Martin to commit suicide. However, Martin inadvertently prays to God for help, causing the gun to misfire and Nefarious to let go of him. One year later, a visibly changed Martin is shown promoting Nefarious' book  not as a \"dark gospel\" but as a rewritten cautionary tale for people to read and realize the demonic influence in society. On his way home, Martin bumps into a homeless woman whom Nefarious has now possessed.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Nefariamous \u2014 the demon is referred to as Nefarious for short.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":0.0,"generation_ms":16381.9949626923,"scoring_ms":550.4450798035,"total_ms":16932.5983524323,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Nefarious","total_tool_calls":4.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":2.0,"judge_reward_func":0.0}

Both Dacus and Bridgers had opened for Baker on separate tours in 2016, and they all ran in similar circles as young up-and-coming performers navigating the [indie](Independent music) scene.\n\nThe three became close and shared their frustrations of constantly being compared to each other as \"[in rock](women)(women in rock)\" despite their considerably different musical styles. Dacus has commented that the idea of women in music \"should not be remarkable whatsoever,\" with Bridgers adding, \"it's not a genre.\" Each has spoken on the tendency of the music industry to pit women against each other, and the group was formed in part to reject this idea. \"I hope people see the three of us and know there isn't competition,\" Dacus has said. \"You don't have to compete with your contemporaries. You can make something good with people you admire.\"\n\nBaker had joked to Dacus years before about a \"pipe dream\" that they could one day all form a band. The three decided to book a [tour](co-headlining)(Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers with Lucy Dacus Tour) in early 2018, and they originally planned to record a single or a [version](cover)(cover version) so that they could perform something together on stage. Upon meeting up that summer, however, they found themselves overwhelmed with ideas, and they ended up forming the band, writing, recording, and self-producing the *[Boygenius](Boygenius (EP))* [EP](Extended play) in four days, with the process involving almost exclusively women.\n\nEach brought one full song and one incomplete idea with them to the group. They sought to create an environment free of the competitiveness and \"bravado\" they had often encountered in previous experiences, and they have remarked that the absence of adult men in the process proved significant, allowing them to relate to each other openly without constantly having to explain themselves. The record was met with universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike; it was named the 12th best album of 2018 by [Music](NPR)(NPR Music), despite being only an [EP](Extended play). Their subsequent [tour](Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers with Lucy Dacus Tour) that November saw them performing all across the U.S., as well as on *[Night with Seth Meyers](Late)(Late Night with Seth Meyers)* and the [Desk](Tiny)(List of Tiny Desk Concerts).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":16764.1761302948,"scoring_ms":427.805185318,"total_ms":17192.3294067383,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus","total_tool_calls":4.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":2.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

The SPLL is composed of three primary subsystems: the M269 Loader Launcher Module (LLM), which also houses the electronic Fire Control System, is mated to the M993 Carrier Vehicle.\n\n[[Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle ATTP.jpg|thumb|Task Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle (ATTP)](File:Task)]\n\nThe M993 is the designation of the M987 carrier when it is used in the MLRS. The M987\/M993 is a lengthened derivative of the [Fighting Vehicle](Bradley)(Bradley Fighting Vehicle) chassis. The ground contact length is increased from  to . Originally called the Fighting Vehicle System, the M987 chassis was designed to serve as the basis for many other vehicles. These included the XM1070 Electronic Fighting Vehicle, the M4 Command and Control Vehicle, the Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle and the Forward Area Armored Logistics System (encompassing three vehicles including the XM1007 AFARV rearm vehicle.\n\nThe original GSRS plan called for 210&nbsp;mm diameter rockets. After European allies became involved with the project, these were replaced with 227&nbsp;mm rockets in order to accommodate the [mine](AT2)(AT2 mine).\n\n[War](Cold)(Cold War) doctrine for the M270 was for the vehicles to spread out individually and hide until needed, then move to a firing position and launch their rockets, immediately move away to a reloading point, then move to a completely new hiding position near a different firing point. These [shoot-and-scoot](shoot-and-scoot) tactics were planned to avoid susceptibility to Soviet [fire](counterbattery)(counterbattery fire). One M270 firing 12 [M26](M26 artillery rocket) rockets would drop 7,728 bomblets, and one MLRS battery of nine launchers firing 108 rockets had the equivalent firepower of 33 battalions of cannon artillery.\n\nThe system can fire rockets or [ATACMS](MGM-140)(MGM-140 ATACMS) missiles, which are contained in interchangeable pods. Each pod contains six standard rockets or one guided ATACMS missile; the two types cannot be mixed. The LLM can hold two pods at a time, which are hand-loaded using an integrated winch system. All twelve rockets or two ATACMS missiles can be fired in under a minute. One launcher firing twelve rockets can completely blanket one square [kilometer](kilometer) with [submunitions](cluster bomb). A typical MLRS cluster salvo consisted of three M270 vehicles each firing all 12 rockets. With each rocket containing 644 [grenades](M77)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition), the entire salvo would drop 23,184 grenades in the target area. However, with a two percent dud rate, that would leave approximately 400 undetonated bombs scattered over the area, which could endanger friendly troops and civilians.[After Cluster Bombs: Raining Nails](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2008\/05\/after-cluster-b\/) , *Wired*, 30 May 2008\n\nProduction of the M270 ended in 2003, when a last batch was delivered to the [Army](Egyptian)(Egyptian Army). In 2003, the U.S. Army began low-rate production of the [HIMARS](M142)(M142 HIMARS). The HIMARS fires all of the munitions of the MLRS, but is based on the chassis of the [of Medium Tactical Vehicles](Family)(Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles). As of 2012, BAE Systems still had the capability to restart production of the MLRS.\n\nIn 2006, MLRS was upgraded to fire guided rounds. Phase I testing of a guided unitary round (XM31) was completed on an accelerated schedule in March 2006. Due to an Urgent Need Statement, the guided unitary round was quickly fielded and used in action in [Iraq](Iraq War).[\"Guided MLRS Unitary Rocket Successfully Tested\"](http:\/\/www.mwjournal.com\/journal\/article.asp?HH_ID=AR_609) , *Microwave Journal*, Vol. 49, No. 3 (March 2006), p. 39. [Martin](Lockheed)(Lockheed Martin) also received a contract to convert existing M30 [Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM)](Dual-Purpose)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition) GMLRS rockets to the XM31 unitary variant.\n\nThe M31 GMLRS Unitary rocket transformed the M270 into a point target artillery system for the first time. Due to [Positioning System](Global)(Global Positioning System) (GPS) guidance and a single  high-explosive warhead, the M31 could hit targets accurately with less chance of collateral damage while needing fewer rockets to be fired, reducing logistical requirements. The unitary warhead also made the MLRS able to be used in urban environments. The M31 had a dual-mode fuse with point detonation and delay options to defeat soft targets and lightly fortified bunkers respectively, with the upgraded M31A1 equipped with a multi-mode fuse adding a [proximity](proximity fuze) [airburst](air burst) mode for use against personnel in the open; proximity mode can be set for  Height Of Burst (HOB). The GMLRS has a minimum engagement range of  and can hit a target out to , impacting at a speed of Mach 2.5.[M31 GMLRS Unitary](http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/systems\/munitions\/m31.htm) , Global security.[Precision Fires Rocket & Missile Systems](http:\/\/www.msl.army.mil\/Pages\/PFRMS\/pgmr.html) , MSL Army. In 2009 Lockheed Martin announced that a GMLRS had been successfully test fired out to .\n\nA German developmental artillery system, called the [Gun Module](Artillery)(Artillery Gun Module), has used the MLRS chassis on its developmental vehicles.\n\nIn 2012, a contract was issued to improve the armor of the M270s and improve the fire control to the standards of the M142 HIMARS. In June 2015, the M270A1 conducted tests of firing rockets after upgrades from the Improved Armored Cab project, which provides the vehicle with an enhanced armored cab and windows.[Improved Multiple Launch Rocket System tested at White Sands Missile Range](http:\/\/www.army.mil\/article\/153172\/Improved_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System_tested_at_White_Sands_Missile_Range\/) , Army, 31 July 2015\n\nIn early March 2021, Lockheed announced they had successfully fired an extended-range version of the GMLRS out to , part of an effort to increase the rocket's range to .

At the end of 1957, American Express CEO [Reed](Ralph)(Ralph Reed (American Express)) decided to get into the card business, and by the launch date of October 1, 1958, public interest had become so significant that 250,000 cards were issued prior to the official launch date. The card was launched with an annual fee of $6, $1 higher than Diners Club, to be seen as a premium product. The first cards were made of paper, with the account number and card member's name typed. In 1959, American Express began issuing embossed plastic cards, an industry first., the company had 133.3 million cards in force, including 56.4million cards in force in the United States, each with average annual spending of $23,496. These include consumer, small business and corporate cards issued by American Express themselves and cards issued by its Global Service Network partners that run on its network (such as Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, and NAB in Australia and Lloyds Bank and Barclays Bank in the UK). On March 1, 2017, Australia's fourth-largest bank ANZ announced that it was no longer issuing American Express cards, with the support phased out entirely by August 5, 2017. American Express is the fourth largest general-purpose card network on a global basis based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and MasterCard.

For example, \"Cassilda's Song\" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:\"The King in Yellow\" in e.g.\n\nThe short story \"The Mask\" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:\"The Mask\" in e.g.\n\nIt is also stated, in \"The Repairer of Reputations\", that the final moment of the first act involves the character Camilla's \"agonized scream and [...] awful words echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa\".\n\nAll of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the \"irresistible\" revealed truths: \"The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect\". Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: \"If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it\" (\"[Repairer of Reputations](The)(The Repairer of Reputations)\").\n\nChambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from \"The Repairer of Reputations\":\n\nHe mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. \"The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever\", he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.\n\nA similar passage occurs in \"The Yellow Sign\", in which two protagonists have read *The King in Yellow*:\n\nNight fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The play is titled The King in Yellow.

Unlike [liner](ocean)(ocean liner)s, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports-of-call, where passengers may go on [tours](Tourism) known as \"shore excursions\". They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by the [tonnage](gross)(gross tonnage)(GT), bigger than many [ships](cargo)(List of largest container ships). Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s; before then, few were more than 50,000GT. In the decades since, the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled. There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000GT or greater. In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). , the largest cruise ship, , has a gross tonnage of 236,857, is  long,  wide, and holds up to 6,988 passengers.\n\nCruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship's crew. Modern cruise ships, while sacrificing some qualities of [seaworthiness](seakeeping), have added amenities to cater to [tourists](nautical)(nautical tourism), with recent vessels being described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\". The \"megaships\" went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas, and feature ameneties such as theaters, fine-dining and chain restaurants, spas, fitness centers, casinos, sports facilities, and even amusement park attractions.\n\nCruise ships require electricity for powering both hotel services and for [propulsion](Marine propulsion). Cruise ships are designed with all the heavy machinery at the bottom of the ship and lightweight materials at the top, making them inherently stable even as ship designs are getting taller and taller, and most passenger ships utilize [fins](stabilizer)(Stabilizer (ship)) to further reduce rolling of tall ships in heavy weather. While some cruise ships use traditional fixed [propeller](propeller)s and [rudder](rudder)s to steer, most larger ships use propellers that can swivel left and right to steer the ship, known as [thruster](azimuth)(azimuth thruster)s, which allow even the largest ship designs to have adequate maneuverability.\n\nCruise ships are operated by [line](cruise)(cruise line)s, which are [companies](company) that market cruises to the public. In the 1990s, many cruise lines were bought by much larger holding companies and continue to operate as brands or subsidiaries of the holding company. For instance, [Corporation & plc](Carnival)(Carnival Corporation & plc) owns both the [mass-market](Mass market) [Cruise Line](Carnival)(Carnival Cruise Line), focused on larger party ships for younger travelers, and [America Line](Holland)(Holland America Line), whose smaller ships cultivate an image of classic elegance. The common practice in the cruise industry in ship sales and orders is to list the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, as the recipient cruise line of the ship.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"236,857 GT.

It was first released in [Japan](Japan) on December 17, 2011, and in [America](North)(North America), [Europe](Europe), and other international territories beginning on February 22, 2012. The console is the successor to the [Portable](PlayStation)(PlayStation Portable), and a part of the [PlayStation](PlayStation) brand of gaming devices; as part of the [generation of video game consoles](eighth)(eighth generation of video game consoles), it primarily competed with the [3DS](Nintendo)(Nintendo 3DS).\n\nThe original model of the handheld includes a  [OLED](OLED) multi-touch [touchscreen](capacitive)(capacitive touchscreen), two [joysticks](analog)(analog stick), and front and shoulder [push-button](push-button) input, and supports [Bluetooth](Bluetooth v2.1+EDR), [Wi-Fi](Wi-Fi), and optional [3G](3G). The Vita features a quad-core [Cortex-A9 MPCore](ARM)(ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore) CPU and a quad-core [SGX543MP](PowerVR SGXMP) GPU. The PS Vita 2000 series, a revised version of the system, was released across 2013 and 2014. It has all of the same features with a slightly smaller size, extended battery life, and an [LCD](LCD) screen instead of OLED. Sony released the [TV](PlayStation)(PlayStation TV), a short-lived, re-purposed version of the Vita that uses a [television](television) screen like a [video game console](home)(home video game console), discontinued at the end of 2015.\n\nThe Vita's design was intended to meld the experience of big-budget, dedicated [game platforms](video)(video game platforms) with the then up-and-coming trend of [gaming](mobile)(mobile gaming) as seen on [phones](smart)(smart phones) and [tablets](tablet computer). However, in the year after the device's successful launch, sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled, threatening to end its lifespan. A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West, combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies, helped keep the platform afloat. Though this led to less diversity in its game library, it strengthened support in [JRPG](JRPG)s, [novels](visual)(visual novels), and Western-developed [games](indie)(indie games). This built moderate sales in Japan and a smaller yet passionate userbase in the West. Though Sony has not released exact sales figures, estimates are around 15 to 16 million units. In the platform's later years, Sony promoted the PlayStation Vita's ability to work in conjunction with its other gaming products, such as [Play](Remote)(Remote Play) of [4](PlayStation)(PlayStation 4) games, similar to the [U](Wii)(Wii U)'s function of [Play](Off-TV)(Off-TV Play).\n\nThe platform stalled in 2017 upon the release of the [Switch](Nintendo)(Nintendo Switch), and was completely discontinued in 2019. The system is regarded as a [failure in the video game industry](commercial)(List of commercial failures in video games), and was significantly outsold by the Nintendo 3DS. No direct successor was released by Sony, though in 2023, a similar remote play accessory, [Q](Project)(Project Q (PlayStation 5)), was announced for release by the end of the year for the [5](PlayStation)(PlayStation 5).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_APHaWX4KUH0A4saSB4vujzCV\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\":\\\"playstation_vita:history\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"## History\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_RmJMwV4xI5sjUASS0SMjpwew\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\":\\\"playstation_vita:background\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Background\n\nAfter the success of [Nintendo](Nintendo)'s [Boy family](Game)(Game Boy family) of [game console](handheld)(handheld game console)s throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, with little market competition, and [Sony](Sony)'s massive success with its [PlayStation](PlayStation (console)) and [2](PlayStation)(PlayStation 2) [video game console](home)(home video game console)s around the same time, Sony entered the handheld market as well. In 2004, it released the [Portable](PlayStation)(PlayStation Portable) (PSP) to compete with the [DS](Nintendo)(Nintendo DS) as part of the [generation of video game consoles](seventh)(seventh generation of video game consoles). After a slow start in the worldwide market, it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the *[Hunter](Monster)(Monster Hunter)* series. With the series being less popular in western regions, it failed to revive the platform in the same way. The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company. It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share, with almost 80 million units sold in its lifespan, roughly the same amount as Nintendo's [Boy Advance](Game)(Game Boy Advance) had during the [generation of video game consoles](sixth)(sixth generation of video game consoles). This is only a little more than half of the sales of its actual market competitor, the DS, which was more than 150 million units by the end of 2011.\n\nRumors of a successor to the PSP came as early as July 2009 when *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* reported that Sony was working on such a device, which would utilize the PowerVR SGX543MP processor and perform at a level similar to the original [Xbox](Xbox (console)). Through mid-2010, websites continued to run stories about accounts of the existence of a \"PSP 2\". Reports arose during the [Game Show](Tokyo)(Tokyo Game Show) that the device was unveiled internally during a private meeting during mid-September held at Sony Computer Entertainment's headquarters in Aoyama, Tokyo. Shortly after, reports of [kits](development)(development kits) for the handheld had reportedly already been shipped to numerous video game developers including both [first-party](SIE Worldwide Studios) and third-party developers to start making games for the device, a report later confirmed by *[Kombat](Mortal)(Mortal Kombat (2011 video game))* Executive Producer Shaun Himmerick. By November, Senior Vice President of [Arts](Electronic)(Electronic Arts), Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that he had seen that the PlayStation Portable successor existed, but could not confirm details. In the same month, [VG247](VG247) released pictures of an early prototype version showing a [Go](PSP)(PSP Go)-like slide-screen design along with two analog sticks, two cameras and a microphone, though the report mentioned that overheating issues had since caused them to move away from the design in favor of a model more similar to the original PlayStation Portable device.\n\nThroughout 2010, Sony would not confirm these reports of a PSP successor but would make comments regarding making future hardware. [Yoshida](Shuhei)(Shuhei Yoshida), President of [Worldwide Studios](SCE)(SCE Worldwide Studios) revealed that his studio, despite usually being more involved with software, had a continued role in future hardware development at the time. In December, [Computer Entertainment](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment) CEO [Hirai](Kazuo)(Kazuo Hirai) stated that Sony aimed to appeal to a wide demographic of people by using multiple input methods on future hardware; buttons and joysticks for traditional handheld game system users, and touchscreens for [phone](smart)(smart phone) users. The device was officially announced by Sony on January 27, 2011, at their \"PlayStation Meeting\" press conference held by the company in Japan. The system, only known by its code name \"Next Generation Portable\", was announced to be a handheld gaming device that aimed for [3](PlayStation)(PlayStation 3) quality visuals, which was later clarified to not be taken at a literal level because, according to David Coombes, platform research manager at [Computer Entertainment America](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment America), \"Well, it's not going to run at 2&nbsp;GHz [the PS3](like) because the battery would last five minutes and it would probably set fire to your pants\". Its power was later described by Sony engineers as about halfway between the PSP and PS3. As rumors had suggested, the device was designed to present \"the best of both worlds\" between mobile and handheld gaming, including a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, a rear touchpad coupled with physical buttons and dual analog sticks. Sony also revealed that the device would be using a mix of retail and digital distribution of games. Further details were announced at [Developers Conference](Game)(Game Developers Conference) 2011, including that Sony would be dropping the PSP's [UMD](Universal Media Disc) disc format in favor of small game cartridges of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB size variants.  along with two cameras, facial detection, head detection and tracking capabilities.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Next Generation Portable (NGP).","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":25531.5041542053,"scoring_ms":663.2499694824,"total_ms":26195.3332424164,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Next Generation Portable","total_tool_calls":5.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":3.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Timestamp: 2023-06-11T04:52:05Z*\n\n---\n\n}}\n\n**Doctor Octopus** (**Dr. Otto Gunther Octavius**), also known as **Doc Ock** for short, is a fictional character appearing in [comic book](American)(American comic book)s published by [Comics](Marvel)(Marvel Comics). The character was created by [Lee](Stan)(Stan Lee) and [Ditko](Steve)(Steve Ditko) and first appeared in *[Amazing Spider-Man](The)(The Amazing Spider-Man)* #3 (July 1963). He is a highly intelligent, [myopic](Near-sightedness), and somewhat stocky [scientist](mad)(mad scientist) who sports four strong and durable appendages resembling an [octopus](octopus)'s tentacles, which extend from the back of his body and can be used for various purposes. After his mechanical harness became permanently fused to his body during a lab accident, he turned to a life of crime, and came into conflict with the [superhero](superhero) [Spider-Man](Spider-Man). He has endured as one of Spider-Man's most prominent villains, and is regarded as one of his three [archenemies](Archenemy), alongside the [Goblin](Green)(Norman Osborn) and [Venom](Venom (Marvel Comics character)). He is the founder and leader of the [Six](Sinister)(Sinister Six), the first [supervillain](supervillain) team to oppose Spider-Man.\n\nWhile usually portrayed as a [supervillain](supervillain), Doctor Octopus has also been occasionally depicted as a conflicted [antihero](antihero) and ally of Spider-Man. Following Spider-Man's death in the 2012 storyline \"[Wish](Dying)(Dying Wish)\", which saw a dying Octavius swapping bodies with the hero and letting him die in his original body, Octavius was motivated to prove he could be a better Spider-Man. As such, he adopted the **Superior Spider-Man** alias, introduced in *[Spider-Man](Avenging)(Avenging Spider-Man)* #15.1 following a cameo in *[Daredevil](Daredevil (Marvel Comics series))* vol. 3 #21 (both December 2012). The Superior Spider-Man possesses all of the original Spider-Man's abilities, memories, and equipment, along with additional gadgets created by Octavius, though he often struggles to live up to his predecessor's legacy and seeks to turn his life around after being a villain for years. In 2013, Marvel launched a 45-issue *[Superior Spider-Man](The)(The Superior Spider-Man)* comic book series focusing on the character's redemption and superhero career. The original Spider-Man has since been resurrected after the death of Otto Octavius. Following *[Spider-Verse](Spider-Verse)*, a copy of his consciousness became a villain, though a second volume of *The Superior Spider-Man* launched in 2018 saw the duplicate taking on the mantle before returning to the Doctor Octopus mantle as an [antihero](antihero), having his soul restored and memories of redemption erased by [Mephisto](Mephisto (Marvel Comics)), before returning to the role of Superior Spider-Man in 2023 in a new series by [Slott](Dan)(Dan Slott).\n\nComics journalist and historian [Conroy](Mike)(Mike Conroy (writer)) writes of the character: \"Created by [Lee](Stan)(Stan Lee) and artist [Ditko](Steve)(Steve Ditko), Doc Ock, as he became known, has become one of the web-slinger's most persistent, enduring, and dangerous foes.\"[Mike](Conroy,)(Mike Conroy (writer)). 500 Comicbook Villains, p.44-45, Collins & Brown, 2004. A fan favorite character and well-known figure in [culture](popular)(popular culture), Doctor Octopus has been featured in various media adaptations of Spider-Man over the years, including feature films, television series, and video games. [Molina](Alfred)(Alfred Molina) portrayed [character](the)(Otto Octavius (film character)) in the films *[2](Spider-Man)(Spider-Man 2)* (2004) and *[No Way Home](Spider-Man:)(Spider-Man: No Way Home)* (2021). In the animated *Spider-Verse* films, [Hahn](Kathryn)(Kathryn Hahn) voiced a female version of Doctor Octopus named Olivia Octavius in *[Into the Spider-Verse](Spider-Man:)(Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse)* (2018), while an alternate Otto Octavius as the Superior Spider-Man appears in its sequel, *[Across the Spider-Verse](Spider-Man:)(Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse)* (2023), in which Molina appearing via archive audio. [Salyers](William)(William Salyers) voices the character in the ''[Spider-Man](Marvel's)(Spider-Man (Insomniac Games series))* video game series and *[Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order](Marvel)(Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order)* (2019).\n\nIn 2009, *[IGN](IGN)'' ranked Doctor Octopus 28th in the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time, and in 2014 rated him Spider-Man's greatest enemy.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Doctor Otto Octavius (Doctor Octopus), often called Doc Ock.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":14438.8680458069,"scoring_ms":815.9639835358,"total_ms":15256.4721107483,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Doctor Octopus","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

presence of bears. The Norwegian text translates into \"Applies to all of Svalbard\".](File:Polar-Bear-Warning-Longyearbyen.jpg|thumb|right|Road)]\n\nConcerns over the future survival of the species led to the development of national regulations on polar bear hunting, beginning in the mid-1950s. The Soviet Union banned all hunting in 1956. Canada began imposing hunting quotas in 1968. Norway passed a series of increasingly strict regulations from 1965 to 1973, and has completely banned hunting since then. The United States began regulating hunting in 1971 and adopted the [Mammal Protection Act](Marine)(Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972) in 1972. In 1973, the [Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears](International)(International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears) was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the [Union](Soviet)(Soviet Union), and the United States. Member countries agreed to place restrictions on recreational and commercial hunting, ban hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, and conduct further research.[International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20030409113042\/http:\/\/pbsg.npolar.no\/ConvAgree\/agreement.htm), 15 November 1973, Oslo The treaty allows hunting \"by local people using traditional methods\". Norway is the only country of the five in which all harvest of polar bears is banned. The agreement was a rare case of international cooperation during the [War](Cold)(Cold War). Biologist [Stirling](Ian)(Ian Stirling (biologist)) commented, \"For many years, the conservation of polar bears was the only subject in the entire Arctic that nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain could agree upon sufficiently to sign an agreement. Such was the intensity of human fascination with this magnificent predator, the only marine bear.\"[Ian](Stirling,)(Ian Stirling (biologist)) *Foreword* in\n\nAgreements have been made between countries to co-manage their shared polar bear subpopulations. After several years of negotiations, Russia and the United States signed an agreement in October 2000 to jointly set quotas for indigenous subsistence hunting in Alaska and [Chukotka](Chukotka Autonomous Okrug). The treaty was ratified in October 2007. In September 2015, the polar bear range states agreed upon a \"circumpolar action plan\" describing their conservation strategy for polar bears.\n\nThe species is listed in Appendix II of the [on International Trade in Endangered Species](Convention)(Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) (CITES) meaning international trade, including in parts or derivatives, is controlled by the CITES system of permits and certificates. The United States government has proposed that polar bears be transferred to Appendix I of [CITES](CITES) which would ban all commercial international trade in polar bear parts. The decision to leave the species listed under Appendix II was endorsed by the IUCN and [TRAFFIC](TRAFFIC), who determined that such an uplisting was unlikely to confer a conservation benefit.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Canada, Denmark, Norway, the Soviet Union, and the United States.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the *Earl of Mornington*, an East India Company [ship](packet)(packet ship) of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [Marine](Bombay)(History of the Indian Navy), equipped with warships such as . These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [of Java](Invasion)(Invasion of Java (1811)).\n\nAt the [of Pulo Aura](Battle)(Battle of Pulo Aura), which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [Dance](Nathaniel)(Nathaniel Dance), Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the , led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off.

On this occasion the Indiamen succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, *General Goddard* played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [Helena](St)(Saint Helena).\n\n[Indiamen](East)(East Indiamen) were large and strongly built and when the [Navy](Royal)(Royal Navy) was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. *Earl of Mornington* became HMS *Drake*.

His reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability. On 19 March 1286, however, Alexander died after falling from his horse.Traquair p. 15 The heir to the throne was Alexander's granddaughter, [Maid of Norway](Margaret,)(Margaret, Maid of Norway). As she was still a child and in Norway, the Scottish lords set up a government of guardians. Margaret fell ill on the voyage to Scotland and died in Orkney in late September 1290. The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the \"Great Cause\", with a total of thirteen contenders laying claim to the throne. The most credible claims were [Balliol](John)(John Balliol) and [Bruce](Robert)(Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale), grandfather of the future king [the Bruce](Robert)(Robert the Bruce).Traquair pp. 23\u201335\n\nWith Scotland threatening to descend into civil war, King [I of England](Edward)(Edward I of England) was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate. Before the process could begin, he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as [Paramount of Scotland](Lord)(Lord Paramount of Scotland). In early November 1292, at a great feudal court held in the castle at [Berwick-upon-Tweed](Berwick-upon-Tweed), judgment was given in favour of [Balliol](John)(John Balliol) having the strongest claim in law based on being senior in genealogical [primogeniture](primogeniture) even though not in [of blood](proximity)(proximity of blood).\n\nEdward proceeded to take steps to progressively undermine John's authority, treating [Scotland](Scotland) as a feudal vassal state, demanding [homage](Homage (feudal)) be paid towards himself and military support in his war against France \u2014 even summoning King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff. The Scots soon tired of their deeply compromised king, and the direction of affairs was allegedly taken out of his hands by the leading men of the kingdom, who appointed a Council of Twelve\u2014in practice, a new panel of Guardians\u2014at [Stirling](Stirling) in July 1295. They went on to conclude a treaty of mutual assistance with France\u2014known in later years as the [Alliance](Auld)(Auld Alliance).\n\nIn retaliation for Scotland's treaty with France, Edward I invaded, storming Berwick-upon-Tweed and commencing the [of Scottish Independence](Wars)(Wars of Scottish Independence). The Scots were defeated at [Dunbar](Battle of Dunbar (1296)) and the English took [Castle](Dunbar)(Dunbar Castle) on 27 April 1296. Edward forced John to abdicate, which he did at [Stracathro](Stracathro) near [Montrose](Montrose, Angus) on 10 July 1296.Dunbar, Sir Archibald H., Bt., *Scottish Kings \u2013 A Revised Chronology of Scottish History 1005\u20131625*, Edinburgh, 1899: p. 116 Here the arms of Scotland were formally torn from John's surcoat, giving him the abiding name of \"Toom Tabard\" (empty coat). By July, Edward had instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1,800 Scottish nobles (many of the rest being prisoners of war at that time).Traquair pp. 15\u201359\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"### Start of the uprising\n\n[[File:William Wallace statue, Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|upright|Wallace statue by D. W. Stevenson on the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, [Edinburgh](Edinburgh)]]\n\nThe first act definitely known to have been carried out by Wallace was his [of William de Heselrig](killing)(Action at Lanark), the English High Sheriff of Lanark, in May 1297. He then joined with [the Hardy, Lord of Douglas](William)(William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas), and they carried out the [of Scone](raid)(raid of Scone). This was one of several rebellions taking place across Scotland, including those of several Scottish nobles and [Moray](Andrew)(Andrew Moray) in the north.Traquair pp.63\u201367\n\nThe uprising suffered a blow when the nobles submitted to the English at [Irvine](Irvine, Scotland) in July. Wallace and Moray were not involved, and continued their rebellions. Wallace used the [Forest](Ettrick)(Selkirkshire) as a base for raiding, and attacked [Wishart](Robert Wishart)'s palace at [Ancrum](Ancrum). Wallace and Moray met and joined their forces, possibly at the siege of Dundee in early September.Traquair pp. 70\u201373\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"#### Battle of Stirling Bridge\n\n[[Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The later Stirling Bridge](File:Stirling)]\n\nOn 11 September 1297, an army jointly led by Wallace and [Moray](Andrew)(Andrew Moray) won the [of Stirling Bridge](Battle)(Battle of Stirling Bridge). Although vastly outnumbered, the Scottish army routed the English army. [de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey](John)(John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey)'s feudal army of 3,000 cavalry and 8,000 to 10,000 infantry met disaster as they crossed over to the north side of the river. The narrowness of the bridge prevented many soldiers from crossing together (possibly as few as three men abreast), so, while the English soldiers crossed, the Scots held back until half of them had passed and then killed the English as quickly as they could cross. The infantry were sent on first, followed by heavy cavalry. The Scots' [schiltron](schiltron) formations forced the infantry back into the advancing cavalry. A pivotal charge, led by one of Wallace's captains, caused some of the English soldiers to retreat as others pushed forward, and under the overwhelming weight, the bridge collapsed and many English soldiers drowned. Thus, the Scots won a significant victory, boosting the confidence of their army. [de Cressingham](Hugh)(Hugh de Cressingham), Edward's treasurer in Scotland, died in the fighting and it is reputed that his body was subsequently flayed and the skin cut into small pieces as tokens of the victory. The Lanercost Chronicle records that Wallace had \"a broad strip [Cressingham's skin](of) ... taken from the head to the heel, to make therewith a [baldric](baldric)k for his sword\".*Chronicle of Lanercost*, ed. H. Maxwell, vol. 1, p. 164.Traquair, p. 76\n\nAfter the battle, Moray and Wallace assumed the title of Guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland on behalf of King [Balliol](John)(John Balliol). Moray died of wounds suffered on the battlefield sometime in late 1297.\n\nAround November 1297, Wallace led a large-scale raid into northern England, through Northumberland and Cumberland.Traquair pp. 77\u201379\n\nIn a ceremony, at the 'Kirk o' the Forest' ([Selkirk](Selkirk, Scottish Borders)), towards the end of the year, Wallace was [knight](knight)ed.

At the race, local cycling club Thy Cykle Ring had set up a home trainer so audience members could see what it was like to cycle up a mountain.

It is organized in 114 [chapters](surah) (pl.:  , sing.:  ), which consist of [verses](\u0101yah) (pl.:  , sing.:  , [cons.](construct case): ). In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in [literature](Arabic)(Arabic literature), and has significantly influenced the [language](Arabic)(Arabic language).\n\nMuslims believe that the Quran was orally revealed by God to the [prophet](final)(Khatam an-Nabiyyin), [Muhammad](Muhammad in Islam), through the archangel [Gabriel](Gabriel) incrementally over a period of some 23 years, beginning on [Al Qadr](Laylat)(Night of Power),[Quran 97:1-5](https:\/\/quran.com\/97) when Muhammad was 40; and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad's most important [miracle](miracle), a proof of his [prophethood](prophethood); and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to [Adam](Adam in Islam), including the [Tawrat](Tawrat), the [Zabur](Zabur) ([Psalms](Psalms)) and the [Injil](Injil) (Gospel). The word *Quran* occurs some 70 times in the text itself, and other names and words are also said to refer to the Quran.\n\nThe Quran is believed by Muslims to be not simply divinely inspired, but the literal [of God](word)(Biblical inspiration). Muhammad did not write it as he did not know how to write. In Muslim theology, the Qur'an is considered to be either \"[created](Quranic createdness)\" or \"uncreated\".[*Ibn \u1e24anbal and the Mi\u1e25na*, 1897](Patton,)(#WMP1897): p.54 According to tradition, several of Muhammad's [companions](Companions of the Prophet) served as scribes, recording the revelations. Shortly after the prophet's death, the Quran was compiled by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it. Caliph [Uthman](Uthman) established a standard version, now known as the [codex](Uthmanic)(Uthmanic codex), which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, [readings](variant)(Qira\u02bcat), with mostly minor differences in meaning.\n\nThe Quran assumes [with major narratives](familiarity)(Biblical and Quranic narratives) recounted in the [Biblical](Books of the Bible) and [scriptures](apocryphal)(Apocrypha). It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for humankind ( ). It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence. Supplementing the Quran with explanations for some cryptic Quranic narratives, and rulings that also provide the basis for Islamic law in most denominations of Islam, are *[hadith](hadith)s*\u2014oral and written traditions believed to describe words and actions of Muhammad.  During prayers, the Quran is recited only in [Arabic](Arabic).\n\nSomeone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a *[hafiz](Hafiz (Quran))*. Ideally, verses are recited with a special kind of [prosody](Prosody (linguistics)) reserved for this purpose, called *[tajwid](tajwid)*. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during *[tarawih](tarawih)* prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, Muslims rely on [exegesis](exegesis), or commentary rather than a direct translation of the text.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_HXBh7lKxBilNgYsc99sNNKfp\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Your Lord has

Their trial, by a special commission, took place on 13 November 1553, at [Guildhall](Guildhall, London) in the [of London](City)(City of London). The commission was chaired by [Thomas White](Sir)(Thomas White (merchant)), [Mayor of London](Lord)(Lord Mayor of London), and [Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk](Thomas)(Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk). Other members included [Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby](Edward)(Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby), and [Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath](John)(John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath). As was to be expected, all defendants were found guilty and sentenced to death. Jane's guilt, of having treacherously assumed the title and the power of the monarch, was evidenced by a number of documents she had signed as \"Jane the Quene\". Her sentence was to \"be burned alive on [Hill](Tower)(Tower Hill) or beheaded as the Queen pleases\" ([burning](Execution by burning#Historical usage) was the [English punishment](traditional)(Burning of women in England) for [treason](treason) committed by women).;  The [ambassador](imperial)(List of ambassadors of the Holy Roman Empire to England) reported to [V, Holy Roman Emperor](Charles)(Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor), that her life was to be spared.\n\n[[File:Lady Jane Grey letter as Queen.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Official letter of Lady Jane Grey signing herself as \"Jane the Quene\".

Her father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and his two brothers joined the rebellion, and so the government decided to go through with the verdict against Jane and Guildford. Their execution was first scheduled for 9 February 1554, but was then postponed for three days to give Jane a chance to convert to the Catholic faith. Mary sent her chaplain [Feckenham](John)(John Feckenham) to Jane, who was initially not pleased about this. Though she would not give in to his efforts \"to save her soul\", she became friends with him and allowed him to accompany her to the scaffold.\n\nOn the morning of 12 February 1554, the authorities took Guildford from his rooms at the Tower of London to the public [execution](execution) place at Tower Hill, where he was beheaded. A horse and cart brought his remains back to the Tower, past the rooms where Jane was staying. Seeing her husband's corpse return, Jane is reported to have exclaimed: \"Oh, Guildford, Guildford.\" She was then taken out to [Green](Tower)(Tower Green), inside the Tower, to be beheaded. According to the account of her execution given in the anonymous *Chronicle of Queen Jane and of Two Years of Queen Mary*, which formed the basis for [Holinshed](Raphael)(Raphael Holinshed)'s depiction, Jane gave a speech upon ascending the scaffold:\n\nGood people, I am come hither to die, and by a law I am condemned to the same. The fact, indeed, against the Queen's highness was unlawful, and the consenting thereunto by me: but touching the procurement and desire thereof by me or on my behalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocency, before God, and the face of you, good Christian people, this day.\n\nWhile admitting to action considered unlawful, she declared that \"I do wash my hands thereof in innocence\". Jane then recited [51](Psalm)(Psalm 51) (*Have mercy upon me, O God*) in English, and handed her gloves and handkerchief to her maid. The executioner asked her forgiveness, which she granted him, pleading: \"I pray you dispatch me quickly.\" Referring to her head, she asked, \"Will you take it off before I lay me down?\", and the axeman answered: \"No, madam.\" She then blindfolded herself. Jane then failed to find the block with her hands, and cried, \"What shall I do? Where is it?\" Probably [Thomas Brydges](Sir)(Thomas Brydges), the Deputy Lieutenant of the Tower, helped her find her way. With her head on the block, Jane spoke the last words of Jesus as recounted by [Luke](Gospel of Luke): \"Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!\" The axe then fell and Jane was beheaded in one clean stroke.\n\nJane and Guildford are buried in the Chapel of [Peter ad Vincula](St)(Church of St Peter ad Vincula) on the north side of Tower Green. No memorial stone was erected at their grave. Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, was executed 11 days after Jane, on 23 February 1554. Her mother, the Duchess of Suffolk, married her Master of the Horse and [chamberlain](Chamberlain (office)), [Stokes](Adrian)(Adrian Stokes (Master of Horse)), in March 1555. She was fully pardoned by Mary and allowed to live at Court with her two surviving daughters. She died in 1559.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The Tower of London.

It stars [Willis](Bruce)(Bruce Willis), [Oldman](Gary)(Gary Oldman), [Holm](Ian)(Ian Holm), [Jovovich](Milla)(Milla Jovovich), and [Tucker](Chris)(Chris Tucker).

To accomplish this, Dallas joins forces with her to recover four mystical stones essential for the defence of Earth against the impending attack of a malevolent cosmic entity.\n\nBesson started writing the story that was developed as *The Fifth Element* when he was 16 years old; he was 38 when the film opened in cinemas. Besson wanted to shoot the film in France, but suitable facilities could not be found; filming took place in [London](London) and [Mauritania](Mauritania) instead. He hired comic artists [\"Moebius\" Giraud](Jean)(Jean Giraud) and [M\u00e9zi\u00e8res](Jean-Claude)(Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res), whose books inspired parts of the film, for production design.

The film won in categories at the [Academy Film Award](British)(51st British Academy Film Awards)s, the [Award](C\u00e9sar)(23rd C\u00e9sar Awards)s, the [Film Festival](Cannes)(Cannes Film Festival), and the [Award](Lumi\u00e8res)(Lumi\u00e8res Award)s, but also received nominations at the [Raspberry](Golden)(18th Golden Raspberry Awards) and [Bad Movie Award](Stinkers)(1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards)s. *The Fifth Element* was a strong financial success, earning more than US$263million at the box office on a $90million budget. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive European film ever made, and it remained the highest-grossing French film at the international box office until the release of *[Intouchables](The)(The Intouchables)* in 2011.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Luc Besson.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":14827.4810314178,"scoring_ms":592.8132534027,"total_ms":15420.5694198608,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Luc Besson","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

son, [Taiji](Hong)(Hong Taiji). Although Hong Taiji was an experienced leader and the commander of two Banners, the Jurchens suffered defeat in 1627, in part due to the Ming's newly acquired Portuguese cannons. To redress the technological and numerical disparity, Hong Taiji in 1634 created his own artillery corps from his existing Han troops, who cast their own cannons in the European design with the help of defector Chinese metallurgists. One of the defining events of Hong Taiji's reign was the official adoption of the name \"Manchu\" for the united Jurchen people in November 1635. In 1635, the Manchus' Mongol allies were fully incorporated into a separate Banner hierarchy under direct Manchu command. In April 1636, [nobility](Mongol)(Mongolian nobility) of Inner Mongolia, Manchu nobility and the [mandarin](Han)(Mandarin (bureaucrat)) recommended that Hong as the khan of Later Jin should be the emperor of the Great Qing.Tumen jalafun jecen ak\u016b: Manchu studies in honour of Giovanni Stary By Giovanni Stary, Alessandra Pozzi, Juha Antero Janhunen, Michael Weiers When he was presented with the [seal](imperial)(Imperial Seal of China) of the Yuan dynasty after the defeat of the last [Khagan](Khagan) of the Mongols, Hong Taiji renamed his state from \"Great Jin\" to \"Great Qing\" and elevated his position from Khan to [Emperor](Emperor of China), suggesting imperial ambitions beyond unifying the Manchu territories. Hong Taiji then proceeded to [Korea](invade)(Second Manchu invasion of Korea) again in 1636.\n\n[[File:Sura han ni chiha. Currency of the farther East. No.850.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|*Sura han ni chiha* (Coins of [Khan](Tiancong)(Hong Taiji)) in [alphabet](Manchu)(Manchu alphabet)]]\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Taiji set up a rudimentary bureaucratic system based on the Ming model. He established six boards or executive level ministries in 1631 to oversee finance, personnel, rites, military, punishments, and public works. However, these administrative organs had very little role initially, and it was not until the eve of completing the conquest ten years later that they fulfilled their government roles.\n\nHong Taiji staffed his bureaucracy with many Han Chinese, including newly surrendered Ming officials, but ensured Manchu dominance by an ethnic quota for top appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong according to how much grain they had: those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated badly, while those with more were rewarded with property. Due to a Han revolt in 1623, Nurhaci turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted and enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them. He ordered that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally with Jurchens, not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji recognized the need to attract Han Chinese, explaining to reluctant Manchus why he needed to treat the Ming defector General [Chengchou](Hong)(Hong Chengchou) leniently. Hong Taiji incorporated Han into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Hong Taiji, Nurhaci\u2019s son, proclaimed the Qing dynasty in 1636 (renaming Great Jin to Great Qing and becoming its emperor).","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":17173.9799976349,"scoring_ms":460.36195755,"total_ms":17635.244846344,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Hong Taiji","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Realizing that they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N' Roses, they decided to form a new band together. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist [Stradlin](Izzy)(Izzy Stradlin) was initially involved, but left after the others decided to find a lead singer. [Kushner](Dave)(Dave Kushner), who had previously played with McKagan in [Loaded](Loaded (band)), then joined the band on rhythm guitar. For many months, the four searched for a lead singer by listening to offered demo tapes, a monotonous process documented by [VH1](VH1). Eventually, former [Temple Pilots](Stone)(Stone Temple Pilots) vocalist [Weiland](Scott)(Scott Weiland) joined the band.\n\nIn 2003, Velvet Revolver played several concerts during the summer and released their first single, \"[Me Free](Set)(Set Me Free (Velvet Revolver song))\". In June 2004, they released their debut album, *[Contraband](Contraband (Velvet Revolver album))*, which debuted at No.1 on the U.S. chart and sold two million copies, re-establishing Slash as a mainstream performer. A year-and-a-half-long tour followed in support of the album. In 2005, the band was nominated for three Grammy Awards: Rock Album of the Year, Rock Song, and Hard Rock Performance for their *Contraband* single \"[Slither](Slither (song))\" which won their first and only Grammy. In July 2007, Velvet Revolver released their second album, *[Libertad](Libertad (Velvet Revolver album))*, and embarked on a second tour. During a show in March 2008, Weiland announced to the audience that it would be the band's final tour; he was fired from the band in April 2008 and Slash insisted \"chemical issues\" led to the split. The following month Weiland rejoined Stone Temple Pilots. Despite Weiland's departure, Velvet Revolver did not officially disband.\n\nIn early 2010, Velvet Revolver began writing new songs and auditioning new singers. By January 2011, the band had recorded nine demos, and was reportedly due to make a decision on their singer. However, the following April, Slash stated that they had been unable to find a suitable singer and that Velvet Revolver would remain on hiatus for the next few years while its members focus on other projects.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Velvet Revolver.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":13442.2121047974,"scoring_ms":660.9752178192,"total_ms":14103.6012172699,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Velvet Revolver","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}
