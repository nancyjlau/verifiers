# Experimental Environments

Newer and more experimental environment classes that may have some sharper edges + change more frequently.

## GymEnv

Universal runner for Gym-compatible environments. Wraps any environment that implements `reset(seed)` and `step(action)` methods (following the OpenAI Gym / Gymnasium API). Supports both old-style 4-tuple and new-style 5-tuple step returns.

## CliAgentEnv

Environment for running custom agent code inside sandboxes. Intercepts the agent's OpenAI API requests via an HTTP proxy server, with each request triggering one `MultiTurnEnv` rollout step.

## HarborEnv

`CliAgentEnv` subclass that loads Harbor-format tasks. Harbor is a task format for agent benchmarks with structured task directories containing `task.toml` configuration and `instruction.md` prompts, along with test scripts for computing rewards.

## RLMEnv

Environment implementing [Recursive Language Models](https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/) (RLMs), an inference strategy where language models can decompose and recursively interact with input context of unbounded length through REPL environments. The root model interacts with a Python REPL that stores the context as a variable, and can spawn sub-LLM calls to process chunks of the context recursively.
